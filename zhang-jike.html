To everyone’s surprise, Zhang started playing table tennis when he was only four years old.</p><p data-slot-rendered-dynamic=true>Apart from that, Zhang did not have to go anywhere to find a coach as his father was a table tennis player, but he also was a children’s table tennis coach at the Second Stadium in Qingdao.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/zhang-jike-in-a-blue-jersey.jpg><p data-slot-rendered-dynamic=true>Even though Jake’s father was a table tennis player, he was a great football fan, and Zico was the best football player in Brazil at that time. So, he named his son Jike after Zico.</p><p data-slot-rendered-dynamic=true>However, we do not know if Zhang is the only child or he has another sibling as the TT player has kept his personal life private.</p><p>But we assume that he does not have any siblings because China has a rule of the one-child policy, and having a second child is regarded crime there. However, this rule has changed now, but Zhang was born in that phase where it was not allowed.</p><p>Zhang went to Tianjin University of Science and Technology, where he graduated with a degree in IT.</p><h2>Body Measurements of Jike</h2><p data-slot-rendered-dynamic=true>Zhang is 35 years old.

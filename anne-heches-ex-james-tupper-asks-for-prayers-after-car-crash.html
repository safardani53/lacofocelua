In addition to Atlas, Heche also shares son Homer, 19, with ex-husband <strong>Coleman Laffoon</strong>.</p><p>Heche dated <strong>Thomas Jane</strong> from 2019 to 2020, and her Hung costar shared his well-wishes for her with the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a> on Saturday. ‚ÄúWhile Anne and I are no longer an item, today‚Äôs tragic news was devastating to me and to all who love her,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMy heart goes out to Anne and her two sons. As of right now Anne is stable and expected to pull through. My thoughts and prayers are with Anne, one of the true talents of her generation. Thank God no one else was hurt.‚Äù</p><p>The Los Angeles Police Department confirmed to Us on Friday that the driver ‚Äî who they would not identify ‚Äî was allegedly speeding while traveling eastbound on Preston Way in Los Angeles. The blue Mini Cooper ran off the road when it entered the intersection of Preston and Walgrove, which has a stop sign, according to <a href=#>KTLA</a>. The car collided with a house on the 1700 block of Walgrove around 11 a.m. PT.</p><p>The vehicle was engulfed in flames and the driver received severe burns. The driver was transported to a local hospital by an ambulance. In photos taken by <a href=#>TMZ</a>, the individual (who the outlet identified as Heche) can be seen wearing charred clothes while on a stretcher and covered in a white cloth.</p><p>The Los Angeles Fire Department confirmed in a video update on Saturday morning that the car went 30 feet into the two-story home, which has been deemed unsafe to enter, and the driver was conscious and able to speak with firefighters while being treated before being taken to the trauma center. Fifty-nine firefighters took over an hour to control the blaze.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>‚ÄúThere was one person home at the time of the incident, an adult female, who was fortunately in the rear of the home, which amazingly spared her from any injury,‚Äù an LAFD official said<a href=#> in the video</a>.</p><p>Before the fiery crash, the ‚ÄúBetter Together with Anne & Heather‚Äù podcast host allegedly drove into the garage of a separate apartment complex. In footage obtained by TMZ, residents are seen trying to help remove Heche from the vehicle, but she seemingly refused assistance, put her car in reverse and sped away from the scene.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapp6aeqmxwqGcrGWVrXqrrcyeqmaspaW9pr6Mmqqkq12bvLN5z6uYsp2iqHqistOeqWabkad6pL7ArJ9o</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./brendan-fraser-through-the-years-photos-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Brendan Fraser Through the Years: Photos</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./yun-ha-jeong-is-a-spicy-singles-inferno-star-who-is-so-popular-its-tiring.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Yun Ha-Jeong is a spicy Singles Inferno star who is so popular its tiring Tue</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

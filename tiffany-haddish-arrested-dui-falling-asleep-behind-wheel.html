drugs or alcohol at this stage.”</p><p>The Watch Commander at the BHPD also told The U.S. Sun that a "reporting party" first called local cops at 5:45 am, claiming a driver was "slumped over the wheel of their car on Beverly Drive."</p><p>According to <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ,</a> who first reported the arrest, the car was still running when police

the law.</a></p><p>In August 2022, she <a href=#>and Aries Spears were accused of sexual harassment and abuse</a>.</p><p>The lawsuit brought on by the two individuals in question claimed Tiffany and fellow comedian, Aries, of grooming and molesting them when they were 14 years old and six years old.</p><p>Her lawyer Andrew Brettler told The U.S. Sun that the claims were "meritless" and that his client "refuses to be shaken down."</p><p>"The two of them will together face the consequences of pursuing this frivolous action."</p><p>However, on September 20,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer

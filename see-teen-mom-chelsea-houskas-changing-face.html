Warms up my little heart? Getting my lips plumped up for the holidays. So, I’m gonna go do that real quick."</p><p>Her next video was post plumping - and the results were immediately noticeable.</p><p>Chelsea's lips looked fuller, while her face was smoother with less wrinkles.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE CHELSEA HOUSKA">READ MORE CHELSEA HOUSKA</h2><p>Even her eyebrows looked darker and healthier.</p><p>"So I did my Botox touch up, and then I have numbing on my lips," she shared in another video story. "It’s just a touch up, so just a little bit."</p><p>After returning home, Chelsea filmed one final update on the finished results - including a new procedure she underwent for the very first time.</p><p>"No bruising or anything like that. I think we did a full half (of her face), or maybe a half. I just wanted a little bit of refresher in my top lip.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>"I did do Botox in my jaw for the first time. I really clench my teeth, especially when I’m stressed or my anxiety is really bad. So (the nurse) said that would help a lot, so I’m excited to see how that goes.</p><p>"But, I love them."</p><p>Back in 2016,&nbsp;<a href=#>Chelsea</a>&nbsp;hinted at getting Botox from her dad, who is a dentist and appeared plenty of times on Teen Mom 2.</p><p>Although Botox is often used by dentists to relax the tense muscles that contribute to TMJ, she shared an Instagram&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">picture</a>&nbsp;where her dad was touching her forehead while those around them shined their cell phone flashlights on them.</p><p>Cole DeBoer, Chelsea's husband, was also in the picture and looked horrified as she got injected.</p><p>To further confirm what was going on, Chelsea had labeled the picture "Botox party."</p><h2>'RAPIDLY CHANGING'</h2><p>The former Teen Mom star recently appeared in a new Christmas-themed<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;TikTok video</a>&nbsp;from her husband,&nbsp;<a href=#>Cole</a>, 34.</p><p>In an online thread, viewers were not laughing at Cole's humorous video but were more distracted by Chelsea's appearance.</p><p>One critic said: "I'm ready for Chels to move past the pumpkin spice complexion phase of her life, and into something a little more understated.</p><p>"She's gorgeous and more fit than she's ever been."</p><p>Another critic added: "With a more natural skin tone, she would glow."</p><p>A third critic mentioned: "Why does her face look younger? Fillers and botox."</p><p>A fourth person wrote: "Is this some kind of filter, or is Chelsea really that orange?"</p><p>A commentator chimed in: "What has she done to her poor face and skin tone? Nooo!</p><p>"Stop it with the fillers! They aren't helping anything!"</p><h2>'NOPE'</h2><p>Over the past two years, many fans have been begging her to lay off the treatments.</p><p>In August, after an earlier procedure, fans claimed Chelsea seemed "unrecognizable" as they&nbsp;<a href=#>begged the reality star to "stop"</a>&nbsp;getting lip fillers.&nbsp;</p><p>One fan commented: "She looks like she has a plastic face."</p><p>Another mentioned: "I don’t recognize her at all."</p><p>A third person noted: "I looked at it for a full minute before deciding it was actually Chelsea," along with a crying emoji.</p><p>While one commentator chimed in: "She’s a pretty girl. Don’t get me wrong, but the fillers. Nope."</p><p>Last year the reality star was accused of getting chin implants and fillers, after a<a href=#> throwback photo</a>&nbsp;that the account Teen Mom Talk shared sparked a debate.</p><h2>WHO'S THAT GIRL?</h2><p>The pic featured&nbsp;<a href=#>Teen Mom</a>&nbsp;stars&nbsp;Chelsea, Jenelle Evans, and Kailyn Lowry all sitting and smiling together, when they all had blonde hair and more natural-looking features.</p><p>After noticing how different she looked back when this photo was taken compared to now, fans wrote: “Back when they all had natural lips lmao” and “All of them have no lips lol.”</p><p>A third told the mother-of-four: “Chelsea don’t tell us you don’t use lip injections ;)”</p><p>Others noted that “Chelsea changed the most” out of all of the Teen Moms.</p><p>Chelsea has never&nbsp;<a href=#>talked about getting any kind of plastic surgery</a>, although she admitted to getting a microlaser peel and broadband light treatment in the past.</p><h2>SPARKING CONCERN</h2><p>Chelsea has also sparked concern among fans a<a href=#>fter showing off her tiny waistline</a> recent social media photos.</p><p>After one concerned user posted a screengrab of one of her Instagram posts showing off her chisled abs, others jumped in with their comments about her shrinking figure.</p><p>"She’s so tiny," someone bluntly commented, while another theorized that the star uses "slimming filters."</p><p>A third person questioned if Chelsea's midsection was "photoshopped," and a fourth stated that the mom-of-four looked "much different."</p><p>Last year, Chelsea opened up about her desire to&nbsp;<a href=#>get back into shape</a>&nbsp;before her 30th birthday.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>Teen Mom 2</a>&nbsp;alum gave birth to her fourth child, a daughter Walker June, with her husband, Cole Deboer, 34, in January 2021 and has been determined to return to her pre-baby weight.</p><p>She has since been posting photos of herself on social media, showing off her weight loss progress.</p><p>During an Instagram Q&A with her followers, the South Dakota native spoke about her personal experience with baby weight gain.</p><p>After one fan asked: "How did you lose postpartum tummy weight?" she explained how her body has changed with every child.</p><p>However, Chelsea lifted her gray sweatshirt to reveal a flat stomach while getting real with some "postpartum stomach talk."</p><p>She admitted to having “a little bit of loose skin and some stretch marks on my front" and added that “most of my stretch marks are on my side.”&nbsp;</p><p>The brunette originally developed the marks when she gave birth to her oldest daughter, Aubree, 13, but disclosed that ”they didn’t get worse with each baby.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Aubree is Chelsea's firstborn child with her estranged ex-Adam Lind.</p><p>She also shares her son, Watson, five, and daughter Layne, four, with Cole.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/plastic-princess-teen-mom-chelsea-779249031.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/www-instagram-com-p-cip7n2huc4d-759068388.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/now-teen-mom-stars-including-776204910.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huaGeDdoKUaKqenV2psqa6jKampmWTnbKtv8SaZKGnpai4or%2BMnJ%2Bappeeu6h5xZqanmc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./vance-smith.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Vance Smith- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Wife, Marriage</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./leonie-hanne.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Leonie Hanne</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp;

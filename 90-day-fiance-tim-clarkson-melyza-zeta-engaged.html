"I believed that my chance at happily ever after with the man I love was gone. Fortunately, I was wrong."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Our engagement feels right," she says. "Putting a ring on it doesn't solve it all, but it's definitely a big step in the right direction, surely one that we wanted to take years ago."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Adds Tim,"Being engaged to Melyza is the most complete I have ever felt in my life."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Tim and Melyza.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Carlie Jean Photography</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although they previously split after Tim cheated on Melyza, after spending some time apart, the couple reconnected and decided to get back together.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Before our proposal, I felt like I was just trying to move on from what felt right for me and my life. I thought the 'right' thing to do was try to move on and the distance was killing me," Tim says. "I now realize how foolish I was — like always — and the bottom line is, Melyza is the only woman I am meant to spend my life with. She sees more in me than I do in myself sometimes and I can never find that in anyone; let's be real, I am a pain."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I know we still have a long way to go for repairing the damage I have done, but we both know how much we love each other, how comfortable we are with each other, and how positive we are that our life together will be amazing," he adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once Tim and Melyza reunited in Colombia, the proposal took place just 24 hours into the trip.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The proposal could not have been more 'cheese stick,'" Tim tells PEOPLE. "I had flown to Colombia to see Melyza and pop the question. We went to a resort in Cartagena and I knew this was my opportunity."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I thought we would get dressed up real nice and go out to dinner at least once; I could not have been more wrong. It was nothing but sandals and shorts the whole time. I decided to take her out on a pier that felt like it was just us in the middle of nowhere with Cartagena in the background," he adds. "I pointed at anything I could to get her to turn around and that is when I dropped to a knee. Best moment of my life."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Tim and Melyza.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Carlie Jean Photography</span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Tim and Melyza.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Carlie Jean Photography</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Melyza adds that she "loved every second" of the proposal "because it was so us."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Tim asked me to walk to a nearby pier so we could take pictures with Cartagena in the background. He pointed towards the city and made a comment about it so I'd turn around. By the time I turn back and look at him, he's down on one knee, holding the most gorgeous ring ever!" she recalls. "I said yes and could not stop shaking for about 45 minutes since the moment he asked because just like everyone else, I couldn't believe it!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for </strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow><strong>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</strong></a><strong> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to sharing footage from their trip on Sunday's episode, the couple also reflected on how happy they were to get back together.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's going great so far," Tim shared.

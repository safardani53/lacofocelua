Proclamation" as the host himself seemed to take a moment to read it. "That is correct."</p><p>Jason and Suzanne did not have the correct response, but since the latter only bet $6000, she would have won on technicality had his answer not been accepted.</p><h2>'YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS'</h2><p>On Reddit one wrote: "I'm not sure how the judges accepted the writing on Final Jeopardy today. The first half worked, but the second... whew."</p><p>Another tore: "There's no possible way to translate that last half into Proclamation, regardless of observed intent."</p><p>And a third: "I am surprised they accepted Emmett's FJ response. That was very illegible to my eyes. (not to downtalk the contestant, because panic would likely make me do the same chickenscratch)."</p><p>A fourth simply wrote: "Unbelievable lol."</p><p>Another said it looked like "'Imansupashun Proklomashin'"</p><p>A sixth brought up an <a href=#>infamous incident coming down to a similar handwritten response last season</a> also in Final Jeopardy.</p><p>"I mean, in the aftermath of what happened with Sadie?" they wrote.</p><h2>HANDWRITING HAVOK</h2><p>Fan-favorite Sadie Goldberger's loss to&nbsp;<a href=#>Megan Wachpress&nbsp;</a>back on June 20th came down to the judge's ruling that her otherwise correct Final Jeopardy response of "Harriet Tubman" was "incomplete".</p><p>Hundreds felt Sadie was "robbed" as she would have won had the show ruled in her favor - and were left&nbsp;<a href=#>upset calling it the season's "most painful loss".</a></p><p>The contestant has scored a comeback since she will be participating in the&nbsp;<a href=#>Second Chance Tournament in October</a>.</p><p>On a recent episode of the "Inside Jeopardy!" podcast,&nbsp;<a href=#>Executive Producer Mike Davies</a>&nbsp;was joined by producer and former&nbsp;<a href=#>"Clue Crew" member Sarah Foss</a>&nbsp;- who hosts the weekly show with him.</p><p>They <a href=#>said Sadie's response was "unfinished"</a> - not illegible - which is why it wasn't taken.</p><p>Producer Foss said with a sigh: "When it comes to Final Jeopardy, you have to finish your response."</p><p>"In Sadie's case, we did go back. We stopped the show, we went back and watched it repeatedly - we can see she went through each of the letters.</p><p>"She wrote a 'T-U-B-M-A' and we knew she had not begun to write an N.'"</p><p>The official&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeopardy! website</a>&nbsp;states written responses to the Final Jeopardy! clue doesn't have to be spelled correctly to win, "but they must be phonetically correct and not add or subtract any extraneous sounds or syllables."</p><h2>'CHANGE NEEDED'</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Andy Saunders</a>, who co-created the J-archive - which has chronicled every Jeopardy! game ever since 1984 on their&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">free website</a>, agreed after tonight that change is needed.</p><p>The expert wondered why the ever-evolving show hasn't switched to keypads for Final Jeopardy.</p><p>"As the show has said dozens of times now, the judges can view the contestants’ pens as they write their responses.</p><p>"They clearly saw Emmett write the letters of the correct response—how it looks at the end generally doesn’t factor into the judging. The judges’ call was thus correct."</p><p>"That being said, any issues at this point are 100% the show’s own doing.</p><p>"Just give the contestants a keyboard—we know the technology is there—and we completely eliminate any and all debates."</p><h2>MEET THE HOSTS</h2><p>Ken and Mayim began regularly filling in for&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href=#>legendary Alex</a>&nbsp;in 2021 after his tragic 2020 passing at age 80 and a whirlwind of Season 37 celebrity guest hosts.</p><p>They included&nbsp;<a href=#>Savannah Guthrie</a>, fan-favorite&nbsp;<a href=#>LeVar Burton</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Dr. Oz</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Aaron Rodgers</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Anderson Cooper</a>, and many more who each scored a week or so at it.</p><p>The search also landed on&nbsp;<a href=#>former executive producer Mike Richards</a>&nbsp;who scored the host gig from the inside before the shocking decision was "reversed" a week later when his misogynistic comments were dug up.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Jeopardy! airs every weeknight - check your local listings.</p><h2>BUZZ-WORTHY MOMENTS</h2><ul><li>Emmett in his Q&A said he was once on a flight and the airline went out of business mid-flight - Ken just burst out laughing</li><li>Ken looked great in a silver tie</li><li>There were no unplayed clues again tonight, fast playing across the board</li><li>Celebrity Jeopardy!'s <a href=#>first episode</a> with host Mayim Bialik debuts Sunday</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-19-at-5.04.09-PM.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/09/NINTCHDBPICT000741102681-2.webp> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-19-at-5.44.20-PM.png><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huYmqEenyRaKGep6CWv6XFjKScp2Wamruvtc2gqmalmajBorfEZpympZWpwW6xzJqlnKGglsGqu81mp6unk6Gurq3ToqanZaeeu6%2Bx0Wg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./too-hot-to-handle-germany-is-set-to-released-on-netflix-soon.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Too Hot To Handle: Germany Is Set To Released On Netflix Soon</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-siebel-newsom.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jennifer Siebel Newsom</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

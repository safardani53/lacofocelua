He has been married quite a few times and been in a few relationships, but who is his latest boo?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Celebrity chef <a href=#>Bobby Flay</a> is quite the culinary genius. From his countless successful restaurants to his <a href=#>Food Network</a> specials, he's taken the cooking world by storm and shows no signs of slowing down.</p><p>But does Bobby have the same kind of success when it comes to his love life? Who is he dating nowadays? Keep reading to find out!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Bobby Flay dating now?</h2><p>Bobby has been dating writer Christina Pérez since before they went public in November 2021. Apparently, she and Bobby's daughter Sophie get along great.</p><p>Sophie told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> in August 2022: "Christina's so sweet and she's also a fellow journalist, so it's really cool to be able to learn from her too. Her and my dad have such a sweet relationship. It's been really so lovely having her around."</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a> that same month, Bobby gave a glimpse into his and Christina's love.</p><p>"I'm a very, very lucky person," Bobby said. "Christina, she's just a light in my life. She's so sweet. She's so smart. She just enhances everything that I'm able to participate in with her. I mean, she's fantastic."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What about Bobby Flay's past relationship with Heléne Yorke?</h2><p>Christina is far from Bobby's first public boo. After bringing Heléne Yorke on as a judge on Beat Bobby Flay in 2017, he confessed on his show: "So I’m going to let you in on a little secret. Last season I went to a Knick game and I met Heléne. Now we kind of date."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Heléne Yorke and Bobby Flay</p></figure><p>By the time that episode aired, they were already dating for a year. But by 2019, after about three years together, the couple split up. Fans got the hint after Heléne posted a photo on her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> Story of herself kissing another man.</p><p>Bobby was pressed about his relationship status by Fran Drescher, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who was a guest on his show</a> shortly after splitting from Heléne.</p><p>In response, he laughed and said, “I’m very single. She [Heléne] kicked me to the curb."</p><p>After getting Bobby to fess up about his relationship status, Fran playfully asked if they should look at art together. Bobby replied: “Are you asking me on a date? I’m kind of blushing right now."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Bobby was married three times before his romance with Heléne.</h2><p>He might be dominating in the cooking world, but that's certainly not the case when it comes to his romantic relationships. Bobby first married fellow cook Debra Ponzek in 1991. They decided to get married only a few weeks after they first met, but the marriage ended after two years.&nbsp;Debra has long moved on with her new husband, Greg Addonizio, with whom she has three children.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: @debraponzek / Instagram</a><p>Debra Ponzek</p></figure><p>After Debra, Bobby moved on to Kate Connelly, who would become his second wife in 1995. They first met on a talk show called Robin Leach Talking Food in 1994, and they instantly hit it off. In 1996, they welcomed their daughter, Sophie Flay. But unfortunately, the marriage didn't last. The two got divorced in 1998.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Seven years later, Bobby found love once again and married actress Stephanie March. They were introduced by Stephanie's Law and Order: SVU co-star Mariska Hargitay. However, the pair didn't get their happily ever after. Reports began to surface about Bobby having an alleged affair, and after more than 10 years together, they split up for good.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Stephanie March and Bobby Flay</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Bobby plan to get married again?</h2><p>During his chat with Entertainment Tonight, Bobby told fans exactly where his thoughts are regarding marriage again. Mostly, that they don't exist at the moment.</p><p>"I've done it a lot. I've practiced that a lot," the chef joked of how he has already been married three other times. "For now, I like it exactly the way it is. I think Christina does, too."</p><p>Does that mean that wife number four is out of the question? Not entirely, but it seems as though Bobby and Christina are simply taking their time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZJunkpfGbrLLmrBmnJGptq%2BzjKemsA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./david-gergen.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>David Gergen Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./amanda-stanton-claps-back-at-body-shamers-denies-eating-disorder.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Amanda Stanton Claps Back at Body Shamers, Denies Eating Disorder</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

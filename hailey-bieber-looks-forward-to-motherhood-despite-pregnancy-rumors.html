The couple <a href=#>dated on and off for three years before reconnecting</a> in 2018. They got engaged one month after rekindling their romance and tied the knot later that year.</p><p>“There’s this thing that happens for women when you get married. Everybody always assumes it’s: First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes the baby. Well, what about all the things I want to accomplish in my business?” the Rhode Skin founder told WSJ. Magazine in January 2022. “I think I had it ingrained in my head that I was going to want to have kids right away and I was going to want to have kids super, super young. Then I turned 25 and I’m like, ‘I’m still super, super young!'”</p><p>Hailey later revealed<a href=#> she felt hesitant about starting a family.</a></p><p>“I literally cry about this all the time! I want kids so bad, but I get scared. It’s enough that people say things about my husband or my friends. I can’t imagine having to confront people saying things about a child,” she told The Sunday Times in May. “We can only do the best we can to raise them,” she shared. “As long as they feel loved and safe.”</p><p>One month prior, Hailey detailed how <a href=#>she has been facing challenges in her personal life.</a></p><p>“I like to make jokes about how I feel because sometimes it’s easier than admitting I’m having a hard time,” she wrote via Instagram Stories in April. “But truthfully since 2023 started I have had some of the saddest, hardest moments I’ve ever had in my adult life and my mind and emotions have been fragile to say the least. And I know so many other people feel the same way I feel, so just know you’re not alone 🫶.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Hailey-Bieber-Addresses-Disheartening-Pregnancy-Rumors-2.jpg><p>In a second post, Hailey issued a message to those who are going through struggles as well. “That being said, let’s keep being there for one another. Let’s be there for loved ones and friends and family and strangers,” she added. “Let’s just be there for people.. let’s keep showing up for each other even when it’s hard. We’re better together 🤍.”</p><p>A source exclusively told Us Weekly at the time that <a href=#>Justin is focused on supporting Hailey.</a></p><p>“[He] couldn’t be more proud of her after she spoke out about the reasons she wants to wait before having children,” the insider shared in May. “It’s something they’ve spoken about with each other plenty, but she’s been through a lot this year and he would never want to pressure her into anything she doesn’t feel 100 percent comfortable moving forward with.”</p><p>According to the source, the duo <a href=#>is waiting to have kids until it feels right</a> for them, adding, “He knows they’ll have kids when the time is right, but it’s a huge decision and something they both need to be on the same page about. Justin will wait for Hailey as long as she needs.”</p><p>While speaking to GQ Hype, Hailey also opened up about how raising her kids out <a href=#>of the spotlight felt “totally unavoidable” now.</a></p><p>“That was before I was married. Didn’t know who I was going to be married to at the time, I’m sure,” she noted. “Maybe I liked the idea at 18 of not raising kids around certain things, but my life is so different now than it was when I was 18. It’s so hard to say what I’m going to do or not do when there isn’t even a child here yet. I don’t even know what it feels like to be a parent other than a dog parent yet. And that’s not the same thing, by any means.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Hailey, however, <a href=#>is still looking forward to motherhood.</a></p><p>“It’s also such a private, intimate thing. It’s something that’s going to come when it comes,” she concluded. “And it’s just, honestly, at the end of the day, so hilarious how much people f—king care. Let me do what I want with my body and you guys can do what you want to do with your body — and let’s just let it be that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahmZmhsrp5waKcm52iYrmwu8qsZJ%2Bnoqyus7CMraZmpZ%2Bptaa%2Bx6imnWWUmsCxtdOeZKmqlZy7orrCsmSrrZ2kv7R7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jay-smith-and-sidepiece-turned-girlfriend-kayla-obrien-its-over.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jay Smith and Sidepiece-Turned-Girlfriend Kayla O'Brien: It's Over!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./richie-mccaw.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Richie McCaw</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

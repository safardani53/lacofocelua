Allegedly, the only place he has responded to the photos is on his spam TikTok account, where he posted a video recently. In the comments of the video, he addressed his absence from his main account.</p><p>"I'm not posting on my main acc for a lil cuz I don't want my parents to see," he commented. "I'm good guys dw.

He doesn’t have a massive part in the film and although fans will recognise him straight away, they’ve never seen him looking like this.”</p><p>Ed will be hoping this role goes down better than some of his others.</p><p>He was trolled after making a <a href=#>cameo in Game Of Thrones</a> and was mocked for his acting in 2019 rom-com <a href=#>Yesterday</a>.</p><p>Ed is so busy that he will be easily distracted even if the reviews aren’t glowing.

Future Nostalgia leaked a few days before it came out in 2020 and Dua was devastated. She has made it clear it must not happen again.”</p><p>Little is known about Dua’s upcoming record but she previously shared that she had a full vision for the album all lined up. She said: “It’s starting to feel good. It’s starting to take shape.</p><p>“I’m very excited about some of the new songs so it’s always exciting to look forward towards something. It has a vision.

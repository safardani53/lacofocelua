Rest in power, Charley. <a href=#>https://t.co/rSIbsLNwYj</a></p><p>— MAREN MORRIS (@MarenMorris) <a href=#>December 12, 2020</a></p><p>Pride, who was the first Black member of the Country Music Hall of Fame, died in Dallas on Saturday at the age of 86. His death came a month after he performed at the Country Music Association Awards, which were held indoors at the Music City Center in Nashville, Tennessee, on November 11.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Maren-Morris-Slams-CMAs-After-Charley-Pride-Dies-of-COVID-at-86-Following-Awards-Show.jpg><p>The show featured artists sitting at tables with none of the attendees apparently wearing face masks. Some of the attendees appeared to have clear face shields on their tables but were not shown wearing them during the broadcast.</p><p>Pride received a Lifetime Achievement Award that night and sang “Kiss an Angel Good Morning” with <strong>Jimmy Allen</strong>. Morris picked up three trophies that night.</p><p>Singer <strong>Mickey Guyton</strong>, who was also at the awards show, replied to Morris’ tweet, writing, “Gurl I thought the same damn thing.”</p><p>A CMA rep <a href=#>told TV Line last month</a> that “every single person” entering the venue was tested for coronavirus and some were tested repeatedly in the week leading up to the awards show “as an extra measure of caution.”</p><p>Hours before the broadcast, <a href=# rel>Lady A announced</a> via Instagram that they would not be attending the CMAs because “one of our immediate family members has just tested positive for COVID-19 this week.”</p><p>Lady A was supposed to perform with show host <a href=#><strong>Darius Rucker</strong></a>, while the group’s <a href=#><strong>Hillary Scott</strong></a> was set to take the stage with <a href=#><strong>Thomas Rhett</strong></a> and other singers. Prior to pulling out of the show, <strong>Charles Kelley</strong> pretaped a performance with <strong>Carly Pearce</strong>, stepping in to replace Lee Brice, who had tested positive for coronavirus.</p><p><a href=# rel>Rascal Flatts also canceled plans to perform</a> at the CMAs after announcing that one of the band’s members had also tested positive. Florida Georgia Line also pulled out after <a href=#><strong>Tyler Hubbard</strong></a> revealed he “got the Rona,” as did musician <strong>Jenee Fleenor</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The CMA <a href=#>released a statement</a> on behalf of the organization and Pride’s representatives on Saturday: “Everyone affiliated with the CMA Awards followed strict testing protocols outlined by the city health department and unions. Charley was tested prior to traveling to Nashville. He was tested upon landing in Nashville, and again on show day, with all tests coming back negative. After returning to Texas following the CMA Awards, Charley again tested negative multiple times. All of us in the Country Music community are heartbroken by Charley’s passing. Out of respect for his family during their grieving period, we will not be commenting on this further.”</p><p><strong>Hear the Us Weekly editors break down the most surprising celebrity births during the pandemic in under 2 minutes!</strong><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGammaKau265zqupoqtdqLmiudJmmqaZXZbEor7DrGSanqSav26vx5qppZ2pYr2ztcOeZJ2hlah6sLKMnKavoZRirrV5l29m</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sam-frank-20030405-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sam Frank (TikTok Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jasmine-reunited-with-gino-in-michigan-hates-everything-on-90-day-fiance-recap.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jasmine Reunited with Gino in Michigan, Hates EVERYTHING on 90 Day Fiance (Recap)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

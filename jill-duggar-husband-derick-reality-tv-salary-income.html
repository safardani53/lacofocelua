And then the other ones that I would work out would be something that I would post with the product.”</p><p>Jill, 30, revealed in the deposition that she made “ballpark” $10,000 from social media promotions and advertisements in 2020.&nbsp;</p><h2>DERICK'S DEPOSITION</h2><p>Jill’s husband <a href=#>Derick</a>, 33, took his deposition on May 25, 2021, where he further elaborated on their income, including from <a href=#>Counting On</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>Jill and Derick appeared on the 19 Kids and Counting spinoff from 2015 up until they left the show in 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>Derick has accused Jill’s father <a href=#>Jim Bob</a> in the past of withholding money made from Counting On.&nbsp;</p><p>He explained in the deposition: “I asked [TLC] if we could get paid when I found out some things and they said there was an agreement that we be paid.”</p><p>He explained he had never been paid for 19 Kids and Counting and talked to Jim Bob about it.&nbsp;</p><p>Derick confirmed he began receiving just $500 to $1,000 per episode of Counting On in "early 2017" until May of that year when they left the show.</p><p>When asked about Jill’s salary from the show, Derick replied: “Somewhere around the same, but more than me. I don’t know if it was $1,000 or what.”</p><p>He then agreed Jim Bob and Michelle “probably” made over $10,000 per episode.&nbsp;</p><p>Derick explained they would receive benefits from the show, including having their groceries paid off by production.</p><p>When asked: “Have Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar treated you right with respect to the TV shows?”</p><p>Derick responded: “I’m not sure, because I think there are a lot of misunderstandings there.</p><p>"Where I thought there should have been. I thought we should have known and been able to decide whether or not we made an obligation to the show.”</p><h2>SOCIAL MEDIA INCOME</h2><p>Derick also went into their recent income, as they made $800 from their YouTube channel in April 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>While in law school, Derick relied on part-time work including a job as a driver for Grubhub, where he made $800 monthly.&nbsp;</p><p>He also went into Jill’s social media promotions, as she made $2,000 for <a href=#>promoting a modest swimwear company Modlily</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Derick said he <a href=#>did not take out loans for law school</a>, as he had a scholarship and paid off the remaining tuition with part-time work.&nbsp;</p><p>They both also had savings.</p><p>Derick even went into his past employment, as he once worked as a bank teller and an accountant for <a href=#>Walmart</a>.</p><p>He explained that during their two-year missionary trip to Central America, they raised their own support and did not receive compensation.&nbsp;</p><p>He then worked at Cross Church as a resident minister, where he made a “small monthly stipend.”</p><h2>FINANCIAL STRUGGLE</h2><p>As The Sun previously reported, Derick also revealed in his deposition that he and Jill, who is pregnant with their third son, <a href=#>relied on food banks</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>He said: “Our neighbors bring boxes of food sometimes. And I also got food through the pantry on campus.”&nbsp;</p><p>Jill and Derick are <a href=#>expecting their third son</a> to join Israel, 7, and Sam, 4.</p><p>She and her husband have<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> put their Arkansas home on the market</a>, as they are moving for Derick's law job after he passed the Bar exam.&nbsp;</p><h2>BREAKING FREE</h2><p>Jill and Derick have been open about receiving no compensation from their time on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Counting On</a>, as reps for TLC have not responded to The Sun's request for comment in the past.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a> reported Jim Bob was in charge of the money made from Counting On, as they received $25,000 to $45,000 per episode.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple didn’t receive money from the series until they quit in 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>Jill said: "That's when we got an attorney involved and finally recovered some of the money. It was a process."</p><p>Derick said in a YouTube video: "It probably ended up being a little more than minimum wage. But we were able to recover at least something."</p><p>The show was canceled in 2021 after oldest brother <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Josh’s arrest for child pornography</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>'LACK OF BOUNDARIES'</h2><p>The Sun previously reported the four sisters also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">requested evidence related to their relationship with parents Jim Bob and Michelle</a> be excluded because it has “no relevance” to the case.&nbsp;</p><p>In the Defendant’s response, they claimed their “allegation of emotional distress opens the door to inquiries into their lives, including their relationship with the parents.”</p><p>The court filing claimed Jill is the only family member who has “sought any type of therapy or counseling following the release of the redacted police reports.”</p><p>The court papers continued that Jill and Derick even entered couple’s treatment because they were “going through some issues” with her family, and especially her father, regarding a “lack of boundaries” related to contractual concerns.</p><h2>'CONTROLLING & FEARFUL'</h2><p>According to the court papers, Jill said during a Preliminary Psychological Opinion by Robert Wynne: “I saw a whole new side to my dad once my husband and I started making decisions that were best for our family, but not in his best interest.&nbsp;</p><p>“Sadly, I realized he had become pretty controlling, fearful and reactionary. He was verbally abusive. Our relationship is not good. It got pretty toxic.</p><p>"We occasionally text on a family group thread, but I don’t feel comfortable being around him and just hanging out. It isn’t good for my mental health right now.”</p><p>Jill also testified that her father has been “verbally abusive to her.”</p><p>The court papers claimed: “They were asked to not to come over to the Duggars’ house without permission from her father and that her father did not approve of her having a nose ring, drinking alcohol, or wearing pants.”</p><h2>JOSH'S LEGAL TROUBLE</h2><p><a href=#>Jill</a> and <a href=#>Jessa</a>, 31, came forward as two of the five victims that were molested in the family home, while <a href=#>Jinger</a> and Joy-Anna have not.&nbsp;</p><p>The case was<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> dismissed ahead of trial</a>, as a judge ruled that the sisters failed to prove the released report caused emotional distress.&nbsp;</p><p>Brother Josh was<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> found guilty of possessing and receiving child pornography</a> on December 9.&nbsp;</p><p>His<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> sentencing has been scheduled</a> for May 25.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More On The Sun">Read More On The Sun</h2><p>Jill’s husband Derick was in attendance for the trial, while Jill made a brief appearance.</p><p>Counting On was canceled after Josh's arrest in April 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000678274975-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000554434179-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000704058152-2.jpg><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2htY2p9eoCPaKGipJxisbazxpqpZqClqK%2BiusNmm56qmZi4br7EmqOirKliwbd50pqjmqqpYravr86mnGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nicky-hilton-says-crop-tops-are-a-little-trashy-8418758.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nicky Hilton Says Crop Tops Are 'a Little Trashy'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./george-clooney-says-his-family-would-die-if-wife-amal-cooked.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>George Clooney Says His Family Would Die If Wife Amal Cooked</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

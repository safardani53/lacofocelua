The first multimedia star, he was one of the most popular and influential musical artists of the 20th century worldwide. He was a leader in record sales, radio ratings, and motion picture grosses from 1926 to 1977. He made over 70 feature films and recorded more than 1,600 songs. His early career coincided with recording innovations that allowed him to develop an intimate singing style that influenced many male singers who followed, such as Perry Como, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Dick Haymes, Elvis Presley, and John Lennon. Yank magazine said that he was "the person who had done the most for the morale of overseas servicemen" during World War II. In 1948, American polls declared him the "most admired man alive", ahead of Jackie Robinson and Pope Pius XII. In 1948, Music Digest estimated that his recordings filled more than half of the 80,000 weekly hours allocated to recorded radio music.</p><table class=wikibox readability=14.5><tr readability=7><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>Harry Lillis Crosby Jr, May 3, 1903, Tacoma, Washington, U.S.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=wk_label>Died</td><td class=wk_value>October 14, 1977, Alcobendas, Spain</td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=wk_label>Resting place</td><td class=wk_value>Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City, California</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Alma mater</td><td class=wk_value>Gonzaga University</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Occupation</td><td class=wk_value>Actor, singer</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Years active</td><td class=wk_value>1922–1977</td></tr><tr readability=8><td class=wk_label>Children</td><td class=wk_value>Gary, Dennis, Phillip, Lindsay (with Dixie), Harry III, Mary, Nathaniel (with Kathryn)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=wk_label>Relatives</td><td class=wk_value>Larry Crosby (brother), Bob Crosby (brother), Denise Crosby (granddaughter), Chris Crosby (nephew)</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Official Website</td><td class=wk_value>https://bingcrosby.com/</td></tr></table><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.allfamous.org/people/headshots/bing-crosby-ef9u-allfamous.org-1.jpg><p>Pop Singer Bing Crosby was born in Tacoma, Washington, United States on May 3, 1903.

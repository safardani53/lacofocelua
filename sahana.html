She was born in the Kerala town of Cheruvathur. Every year on May 12th, she would celebrate her birthday. And now, on her 21st birthday, she has died. It is heartbreaking to learn that people died on their birthday.</p><p>She was a carefree young lady. Looking through her social media profiles, it appears she was living her life to the fullest. Nobody expects a young girl like her to say goodbye to everyone so soon. It is difficult to tell you about her schooling and education because she is no longer with us in this world. Because she never appeared for a personal interview during her life, in which she could have discussed her school and college experiences.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Sahan-1.jpg><h2>Sahana Family</h2><p>After doing extensive research on Sahana’s family, she never mentioned them to anyone. But after she died, her mother, Uveyma, went public and claimed that her daughter’s husband had murdered her.</p><p>Uveyma revealed that her daughter was subjected to mental torture at the hands of her husband. Mrs. Uveyma revealed that her daughter used to tell her that her husband Sajjad doesn’t let her invite anyone to their home. Uveyma also claimed that Sajjad and his parents are to blame for her daughter’s death because they used to harass her.</p><p>“My daughter was murdered, not committed suicide.” She used to cry all the time and complain that they were torturing her. He used to get drunk and cause havoc. His parents and sister were also torturing her, so I suggested they move to a different house. Even after that, my daughter informed me that he was misbehaving with her and was after money. We had used the 25 sovereigns of gold that we had given. “She had wanted to meet us on her birthday,” Uveyma told the media on Friday (May 13).</p><h2>Career</h2><p>She has modeled for Kerala Gold & Diamond, Ali’s Gold Palace, and other local clothing companies. She caught the attention of producers and directors after she began posting her stunning photos on Instagram in 2020. She was then given the opportunity to model for a number of high-profile brands.</p><p>She is said to have worked on the 2021 Tamil film LockDown. However, we have found no evidence that she was a part of the LockDown film. She also recently launched her YouTube channel. However, she has yet to post any videos of herself on her YouTube channel.</p><h2>Sahana Husband, Marriage</h2><p><strong>Sahana</strong> had a husband named Sajjad. She posted a picture of her husband on her Instagram story a few weeks ago. A picture of her with her husband on her Instagram story suggests that the couple was deeply in love. But what drives her to commit suicide is still a mystery to many. She married her husband a year and a half ago.</p><p>Her husband had just returned from Qatar. He used to work in Qatar but was now unemployed and living with his wife. They were both renting an apartment in Kozhikode. Her mother stated in the media that Sajjad refused to return to Qatar after learning of her successful acting and modeling career.</p><h2>Sahana’s Net Worth</h2><p><strong>Sahana</strong> had increased her net worth to 1.5 crore INR and had begun to live a luxurious life before her death. However, a bad phase in her life that began on May 12, 2022, ended her life, and she will no longer be a part of any media discussions.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>Munna Simmon, a South actor and executive producer, shared photos and videos of Sahana after her death.</li><li>Munna Simon revealed that she was a talented actress.</li><li>Munna stated that he was shocked to learn of her death.</li><li>She has 64k Instagram followers who adore her.</li><li>Shinchain was her favorite cartoon character.</li><li>She used to have Shinchain cartoons printed on her goodies.</li><li>She last posted a photo of herself on the day she died.</li></ul><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiqmqCRo65w</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cheryl-topless-music-video-liam-payne-lookalike.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cheryl strips topless and gets in bed with Liam Payne lookalike for Let You music video as fans are</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./man-19-dies-after-car-collides-with-street-sign-in-stevenage.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Man, 19, dies after car collides with street sign in Stevenage</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

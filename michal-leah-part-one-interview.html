Though she’s still “technically a teenager,” she says to <strong>HollywoodLife</strong>, Michal has already experienced some profound experiences that she has effortlessly translated into a quintet of ethereal soul-pop songs. part one, which collects the previously released “The Way I Love You” and “Used To It,” formally introduces Michal as another star in the constellation guiding people through their journeys of growth and heartbreak.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“Growing up is weird and hard,” Michal tells <strong>HL </strong>when discussing “Pretending,” one of the songs on part one. She has spent the last year digesting this needlessly complicated process we know as life, which has produced such observations on how we act when others are around (“Tinted Windows”), how changing means letting go of people you once held close (“Pretending”), and how love is a process that leaves no one unaffected, good or bad (“The Way I Love You”). For someone her age, these are poignant revelations that touch upon some profound, universal truths, hinting that part one is just the beginning of a very dynamic creative career.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>For the 840k followers on TikTok and the over 118k fans on Instagram, Michal has been that sad soul-pop singer helping them smile through their tears (they also caught Michal when she toured with <strong>Eloise </strong>in late 2022, and are eagerly watching Michal’s social media for announcements of future shows.) Those fans have also been playing part one on repeat since its release, but for those who haven’t heard her EP yet (or for those who would like some extra context to the songs), Michal has shared with <strong>HollywoodLife </strong>the following track-by-track breakdown.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Michal-Leah-DEbut-EP-WJ-embed-2.jpg><h2>“Used To It”</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“When people listen to ‘<strong>Used To It,’ </strong>I want them to picture revisiting the room they were standing in when they knew it was over. Those first few steps you took down the stairs of your now ex’s apartment building onto a once familiar sidewalk. Was it cold? Where did you go first? How long did you wait to download a dating app? When, if ever, did you stop comparing every date to that person? The feeling is temporary, I know that, but when you’re in it there is not enough empowering break-up songs in the world to pull you out of it. You know it won’t feel like this forever, but also wonder, what if it does? I wrote this for that moment, people inside of it deserve some company.”</p><h2>“Tinted Windows”</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“Some people wear sunglasses at night to look cool, others to hide the fact that they are scared shitless of big social gatherings, like hiding behind ‘Tinted Windows.<strong>‘ </strong>Even extroverts get social anxiety, and I became aware of my own at the start of high school when I went to my first, like, really real big high school party. It was almost like watching myself from behind tinted glass, or wanting to watch others from a place I could hide a little.”</p><h2>“Almost Loved You”</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“I’ve never been to London, but when I do finally get the chance to go, there is one guy, in particular, I plan to avoid like the plague. I was 17, he was 21, he was so cool and evasive and bounced between being available and unavailable so often that if I cut my hair every time he stopped talking to me, I’d be completely bald right now.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“Due to the distance of me being in Chicago and him being in the UK, all we could ever do was talk, and he always knew exactly what to say to keep me falling. ‘Almost Loved You<strong>‘ </strong>is a song I wrote at the height of realizing this guy was full of it, and it was time to move on.”</p><h2>“Pretending”</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“These past 6-12 months have been a time of such massive growth for me that it’s hard for me to believe I’m technically still a teenager. Everyone always says that growing up comes with a lot of growing pains, like moving, trying your first really, really bad beer, and growing apart from friends you were once inseparable with. As I learned more about who I was, I also learned more about who I wasn’t, and there were some people in my life that made me feel more like myself and others who didn’t. I wrote ‘Pretending’<strong>&nbsp;</strong>about the shrinking I felt I needed to do around one of my life-long friends. Growing up is weird and hard. I still love this person a lot, I just want to learn how to love myself, too.”</p><h2>“The Way I Love You”</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“The Way I Love You’<strong>&nbsp;</strong>is about a boy who changed the way I look at love and look at loving myself. I am just so in love with my boyfriend, it’s cheesy and annoying, and I don’t even care. I’m so proud to be a part of a love like this, and this song just poured out of me. Seeing everyone’s reaction and connection to it has multiplied the meaning of this song for me by infinity. This song changed my life, and so did this boy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH1ze49yZqahk52urXnLnpihZaCWv7V5zqecZqGeqbKzwsiermg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tnab9wsvykpxhwwbr80gn8haqmldg7j8.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Stream Movies, Shows &amp;amp; Live TV</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kate-hudson-enjoys-family-outing-with-sons-and-danny-fujikawa.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kate Hudson Enjoys Family Outing With Sons and Danny Fujikawa</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

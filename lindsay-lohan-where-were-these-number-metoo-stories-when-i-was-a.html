suggested that because Weinstein had never assaulted her, these <a href=#>multiple other actresses</a> must be lying?</p><p>That was what you call a "bad take."</p><p>Well, Lindsay isn’t done commenting … unfortunately.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>We remember Lindsay Lohan’s history with domestic violence all too well. As with so many aspects of Lindsay’s life, she deserved so much better.</p><p>There was an alarming <a href=#>photo of Lindsay’s injured leg</a> shared early in 2016 along with a somewhat cryptic message.</p><p>At the time, the world didn’t even know which person she was vaguely alleging of having done it.</p><p>It wasn’t until months later that <a href=#>Lindsay Lohan finally accused Egor Tarabasov of domestic violence</a>.</p><p>Alarmingly, she said at the time that no woman should stay with a man who hits her if he refuses to apologize, as if abusers don’t apologize all of the time and as if an apology for something so vile could change anything.</p><p>But fans from all around the world read the harrowing tale. Lindsay, who had already been so much — from her awful parents to her child stardom — should never have had to endure domestic abuse.</p><p>No one should.</p><p>Fans only grew more worried when <a href=#>Lindsay Lohan sported a tremendous bruise</a> on her arm around that same time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>And all of this was after Lindsay cried out for help after&nbsp;<a href=#>Egor&nbsp;allegedly tried to strangle her</a>.</p><p>She revealed that she ultimately realized that you can’t stay in a relationship just for love, and she’s absolutely right.</p><p>That is why fans were so, so disappointed in Lindsay Lohan’s response to the <a href=#>Harvey Weinstein scandal</a>. At first, you remember, he was accused of being a serial harasser.</p><p>That was before women came forward and accused him of being a serial rapist, as well.</p><p>But sexual harassment is a big deal all on its own. And it impacts millions of women every single day.</p><p>Many fans were crushed by Lindsay’s support of Weinstein.</p><p>(When his own wife leaves him, maybe it’s well past time to give him the benefit of the doubt)</p><p>Just because Weinstein had never invited Lindsay, personally, to come and shower in front of him isn’t exactly proof that he never did that — or worse — to other women.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Apparently, Lindsay Lohan saw the reactions as accusations that she isn’t pro-woman.</p><p>And, yeah, that was at least part of the response.</p><p>She posted and deleted a defense of herself … and included a very accusatory tone.</p><p>Her initial caption read:</p><p>"Whatever anyone says, I am FOR #womenempowerment&nbsp;as if most women in America cared how I was abused by my&nbsp;exfiancé… when not one person stood up for me while he was abusing me…"</p><p>She seems to be ignoring countless people who posted concern for her and condemnation of her (now former!) fiance.</p><p>(I know that I certainly wrote about it at the time)</p><p>"You could only imagine what it feels like to come out as a #strongwoman&nbsp;BUT, acknowledge this, we all make our own choices and wake up in our own beds in the morning."</p><p>That line does not make much sense. At all.</p><p>"I prefer to go to my home and wake up alone. #BESTRONG&nbsp;let us not blame anyone as #karma will always takes its toll. #womensrights"</p><p>Note that her first hashtag reads "be strong," not "best rong."</p><p>So … Lindsay spiraled into incoherence in a way that we normally expect from people who are still mastering English and are not native speakers.</p><p>But you know what? Anyone can find that their thoughts didn’t quite translate to paper.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>In any case, Lindsay Lohan deleted that original caption and replaced it.</p><p>The&nbsp;Mean Girls&nbsp;star and tabloid legend has changed her tune … up to a point.</p><p>At the very least, she’s much more succinct and no longer seems to be trying to shame the women of America.</p><p>"Whatever anyone says, I am FOR #womenempowerment&nbsp;#strongwoman&nbsp;#BESTRONG&nbsp;#karma will always takes its toll. #womensrights"</p><p>We guess that, to Lindsay, she saw a fan response but not a massive movement that she now sees in the wake of the Weinstein scandal.</p><p>Maybe that rubbed her the wrong way. Maybe she was just being defensive and trying to deflect.</p><p>Honestly, we don’t even know if poorly Lindsay herself could tell us why she says some of the things that she does. Let’s cut her some slack.</p><p>Remember that, in her own way, Lindsay is sharing a #MeToo story.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>#MeToo: Stars Share Stories of Sexual Harassment, Assault</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><p>"Whatever anyone says, I am FOR #womenempowerment&nbsp;#strongwoman&nbsp;#BESTRONG&nbsp;#karma will always takes its toll. #womensrights"</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2Z9cLjIp5usmaliubC0wKdksKCVp7Juw8SrnGasmJrApnnNrqSbnaJiuqbAzqhkrKyfp7amv4ywn56mXZ56uK3SZpho</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-ben-verlander-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Ben Verlander Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./joh-vonnie-jackson.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Micheal Jackson Sister Joh Vonnie Jackson Age, Parents, Sibling, Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

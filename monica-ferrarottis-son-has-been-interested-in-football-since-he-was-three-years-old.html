Rodrigo Javier De Paul is his full name. Professionally, he is a footballer who plays as a midfielder for the Atletico Madrid club as well as the Argentina national team. He was originally from Sarandi, Argentina.</p><h2>Quick Facts</h2><table id=factsDetail class=highlight><tbody><tr><td><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td>Monica Ferrarotti</td></tr><tr><td><strong>First Name</strong></td><td>Monica</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Last Name</strong></td><td>Ferrarotti</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td>Celebrity Mother</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td>Argentine</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth Country</strong></td><td>Argentina</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Gender Identity</strong></td><td>Female</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sexual Orientation</strong></td><td>Straight</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Marital Status</strong></td><td>Divorced</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spouse</strong></td><td>Roberto De Paul</td></tr><tr><td><strong>No Of Children</strong></td><td>3</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Has Monica already divorced her husband?</h2><p>Monica got married to a guy called Roberto De Paul. Unfortunately, the couple did not last a lifetime together. Monica’s ex-husband remarried, but she remained unmarried. As a single mother, she was responsible for all of her children. She worked extremely hard to provide for her family. To be clear, she is an independent and powerful woman who has received a solid financial education. She and the rest of the family lived nicely like other ordinary homes since she earned money on her own. Their friendship and unity are the keys to their survival despite their poverty in Argentina.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Monica-Ferrarotti-2.jpg alt="Monica Ferrarotti" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>After a lengthy period of dating, they married.</h2><p>Rodrigo and Camila Homs are newlyweds. The two people met while they were teenagers. When the chance presented itself, the woman brought Rodrigo with her. The couple traveled to Valencia first, then to Italy. They remained for five years, and after being in a relationship for a few years, they formally married. Then he moved to Spain from Italy.</p><p>The woman then thanked Udine from the bottom of her heart for opening doors and providing her with great people who would be with her forever. She also said that her family has grown to include two children and a dog, totaling five members.</p><h2>Getting divorced despite having two children</h2><p>Neither of them has said anything about it, but Rodrigo’s partner’s response hinted at it. She loved the remarks on her social media account that said, “You let me go so lightly that you questioned all you told me.” The difficulties in their relationship started when Rodrigo became suddenly involved in the Wandagate.</p><p>According to reports, the athlete may have had an affair with a woman called China Suarez. He was also related to Tini Stoessel. This myth started when Tini, the singer, went to Madrid, and many assumed she would meet Rodrigo there. Rodrigo’s wife then stopped following Tini on social media and stopped exchanging images with her husband.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Monica-Ferrarotti-3.jpg alt="Monica Ferrarotti" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Rodrigo De Paul began playing football at the age of three.</h2><p>He, like many others, had spent his boyhood playing street football. He was interested in football since he was three years old. As a result, his first team chose him for the role of goalie. He didn’t feel comfortable in that position, so he moved to the front.</p><p>As a forward, his performance improved and was recognized, which alters the whole narrative. One of the Racing Club instructors who also trained young Rodrigo when he was at the youth academy mentioned seeing Rodrigo on the children’s football squad when he was nine years old.<br>The coach described him as the “jewel” of the 94 class.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>Monica’s income has not yet been disclosed, therefore we will depend on her son Rodrigo’s net worth, which is predicted to reach $10 million in August 2023. In the football world, he is regarded as a very competent and popular player.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGikqKaZmK5ussSrqZqqn6nBqr%2BMrKanZZiWwG6uxJ6lZqGeqbKzsdKtnJ1lmaN6p7vOrZmapJxiwKq6wp5koZ1drK60edOhqZ6dXa6yor7SZqalnF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./elizabeth-olsen-through-the-years-photos-4304390.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>See Photos Of WandaVision Star Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mark-bryan.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mark Bryan</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

And just in case somebody doesn’t realise how important you are as chef of the whole shebang, there’s even an apron with a useful pocket on the front and a Weber logo to remind them.</p><p>The tongs, basting brush and spatula feature soft-touch handles for a comfortable grip.</p><p><strong>Material: </strong>soft-touch handles,<strong> clean: </strong>hand wash,<strong> number of items: </strong>5</p><h2><strong>What to look for in a BBQ tool set</strong></h2><p>BBQ sets come in all shapes and sizes, but the best BBQ tool sets will include at least one pair of tongs – crucial for turning food, especially meat, while cooking to make sure it doesn’t burn, a carving fork for lifting cooked food from the grill easily, and a spatula. A basting brush is another useful tool, great for adding just the right amount of extra oil during cooking to make sure food, such as vegetables, doesn’t dry out.</p><p>For big BBQ fans then a knife, skewers, bottle opener, leather or silicone barbecuing gloves, and perhaps corn cob holders are optional extras sure to be high on their wishlist.</p><p>If you cook for vegetarians as well as meat eaters, then consider a second set of BBQ tools specifically for them. Just as you keep a portion of your barbecue free for veggie food, so your vegetarian guests will appreciate you using separate cooking tools.</p><h2><strong>How much do BBQ tool kits cost?</strong></h2><p>There are BBQ tool sets available to suit all budgets, from the inexpensive to this luxury set from <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Mr Porter</a> that costs a heart-stopping £2,925!</p><p>In between the two extremes, there’s a huge choice of products that look good and do the job well. You will be able to buy a perfectly good set of BBQ tools that will last, for around £40.</p><h2><strong>Where to buy BBQ utensil kits</strong></h2><p>You can buy BBQ utensil kits at many shops on the high street, such as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Robert Dyas</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Wilko</a>. Large DIY chains such as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">B&Q</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Homebase</a> tend to sell a range of barbecues each summer so they usually have a selection of tool sets also, as do supermarkets, including <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Asda </a>and Tesco.</p><p>Online, we found the sets in our roundup at:</p><h2>What tools do I need for a BBQ?</h2><p>Tongs are probably the most important tool to have in your kit - they can be used for everything from turning over those sausages to picking up veg that’s fallen down the side.</p><p>Length matters here. Bigger barbecues will require longer tongs while smaller tongs will be easier to use on smaller barbecues.</p><p>Something that’s around 16in should work for most barbecues while 12in is the shortest size you should go for.</p><p>We have a detailed guide on choosing the <a href=# rel=noopener>best BBQ tongs</a>.</p><p>Next, you’ll want a spatula or turner - these are essential for keeping those burgers and buns intact and can be handy when you’re picking up a few bits of food at the same time.</p><p>A fork will also come in handy if you cook larger joints of meat that are too heavy to lift with your tongs alone.</p><p>Tongs, turners and forks will generally come in a set but you may also want to build your own kit with other accessories.</p><p>A basting brush is useful if you want to add more sauces or oil during cooking for example. You might also want to invest in one of the <a href=# rel=noopener>best meat thermometers</a>&nbsp;to make sure your food is cooked all the way through.</p><p>And if you’re particularly clumsy, a good pair of heat-resistant gloves can be a great way to protect your hands from burns.</p><h2>What is the best BBQ tool set?</h2><p>It all depends on your budget and your needs.</p><p>You'll need a couple of basics though: tongs, spatula and fork. If you just do a handful of barbecues a year, that might well be enough.</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Range's 3-piece set</a> is the cheapest for this but you might want something a bit more stylish, like the set from <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">John Lewis</a>.</p><p>But if you're more likely to show off to family and friends, or if you cook regularly, a decent kit is essential.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Argos Home 23-piece kit</a> has pretty much everything you need for a decent price.</p><h2>How to clean BBQ tools</h2><p>You can generally clean your BBQ tools in a similar way to how you would clean your kitchen cutlery or indoor oven utensils.</p><p>First, soak your tools in a bowl of hot water and with a grease-cutting washing-up liquid.</p><p>Once the grease begins to soak off, you can use a rough sponge or brush to easily scrub the tools clean.</p><p>Some tools are also dishwasher safe, which will save you lots of time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZmppZ2uDeIKVaJmeq6Rir6O9jJuYq5qVmMKmedOopqVlo5rBtHs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bindu-panicker.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Bindu Panicker net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./interview-with-the-vampire-cast-then-and-now-photos-4255392.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tom Cruise &amp;amp; More Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

The company announced his death Monday, sharing that he died peacefully on Sunday.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Born in N.Y.C., Born's family moved in the 1930s to Bethlehem, Penn. where Just Born is still based. After graduating from Lehigh University, Born enlisted in the U.S. Navy where he served as a radar specialist and a lieutenant on a destroyer in the Pacific. The Navy ultimately sent him to both the University of Arizona and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he studied math and physics.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though he had aims to attend medical school and had been accepted, he decided to help out at his father's business while he awaited the start date, and ultimately felt it was his calling. He stayed with the company until retirement.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At Just Born, where he was president for 30 years starting in 1959, Born led a legacy that involved the invention of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Peeps</a>, the popular marshmallow bunnies. He revolutionized the technology to change the process of making the marshmallow delights — cutting the 27-hour process down to a six-minute mechanized procedure. Born also invented <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Hot Tamales</a> by finding a way to rework the Mike and Ike candies.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Just Born Quality Confections</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He learned the business from the ground up, focusing on the technical and processing aspects of candy making," Ross Born, Bob's son, said in a statement. "At the same time, he recognized the importance of developing people, and he discovered wonderful talent that made a positive impact on the business."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though Born eventually stepped away, he visited Just Born often and last visited the factory in February 2019 when he was honored by the city of Bethlehem after they named the first day of the Easter season as "Bob Born Day," according to the company.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Bob will be remembered as a tireless and passionate advocate for the candy industry and a wonderful supporter of our community," David Shaffer, the board chair and co-CEO of Just Born, said in a statement. "Bob was our second-generation family member whose dedication was instrumental in Just Born reaching our 100-year milestone. We extend our deepest sympathy to his son, Ross, and the entire family."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>William Thomas Cain/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After retiring, Born moved to Florida where he pursued his other passions, including photography.

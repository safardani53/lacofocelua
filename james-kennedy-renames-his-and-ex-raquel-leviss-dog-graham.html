The former couple got the dog in 2018, three years <a href=#>before announcing their split</a>. As the costars navigated <a href=#>their post-breakup relationship</a>, Leviss, 28, maintained primary ownership of the dog.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/James-Kennedy-Renames-Little-Beauty-Graham-After-Dog-Alleged-Biting-2.jpg><p>“I’ve missed Graham more than I’ve missed Raquel,” Kennedy told cameras in a February episode of the Bravo show after a tense discussion with his ex. “This is f—ked up, honestly. Maybe if I could see him once. I f—king miss him.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/James-Kennedy-Renames-Little-Beauty-Graham-After-Dog-Alleged-Biting.jpg><p>Kennedy explained on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen in December 2021 that the puppy was “a graduation present” from Leviss’ mom. “So technically, <a href=#>Graham Cracker is her dog</a> even though we raised him together,” he said. “I’ll always love the little guy and I do miss him right now. … There was no big fight or anything, so I don’t see <a href=#>why I couldn’t see Graham Cracker</a>.”</p><p>Earlier this month, Kennedy revealed that <a href=#>he and the dog were finally reunited</a> — this time for good. “Look who made his way back home, back into my life,” he gushed in a Wednesday, July 19, Instagram post. “I’ll take care of you forever, and I love you.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/James-Kennedy-Renames-Little-Beauty-Graham-After-Dog-Alleged-Biting-Raquel-Leviss.jpg><p>Pump Rules fans were overjoyed for Kennedy, but the sweet moment soon took a surprising turn. Leviss’ mom, <strong>Laura Leviss</strong>, spoke to Entertainment Tonight about <a href=#>the dog’s alleged behavioral issues</a> and the decision to rehome him <a href=#>as her daughter sought mental health treatment</a>. (Raquel checked into a facility earlier this year amid the fallout of her cheating scandal with<a href=#><strong> Tom Sandoval</strong></a>.)</p><p>Laura alleged to the outlet on Friday, July 21, that the doodle “had bitten several people” in the past and needed training. “When Rachel went into the mental health facility, she asked us to care for Graham as we have many times before. While caring for him he bit me to the bone, causing severe damage,” she claimed, using her daughter’s legal name.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>According to Laura, the family enlisted <a href=#><strong>Lisa Vanderpump</strong></a> and her Vanderpump Dogs Rescue organization to help <a href=#>find a new home for the pooch</a> after he allegedly bit two trainers at California Doodle Rescue. “My daughter nor I ever dumped Graham and want nothing but the best for him,” she asserted.</p><p>Raquel, for her part, <a href=#>has stayed quiet</a> about the dog drama. While Kennedy and their costars have been filming season 11 of Vanderpump Rules, <a href=#>Raquel was recently spotted visiting family in Tuscon, Arizona</a>, after reportedly leaving her mental health facility.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmZ2awG63xKelnpypYr%2BmusCmnKxlmJ7Abq3NnWSesF2nrrLBxKVkpZ2mnsC0ecOonmafopa1ormO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kerser.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kerser- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Ethnicity</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./james-hoffmann-19791211-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>James Hoffmann (Entrepreneur) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

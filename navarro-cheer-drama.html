You try to leave but you keep getting pulled back in.</p><p>For former Navarro cheerleader <a href=#>La'Darius Marshall</a>, it's a bit more complicated than misplaced loyalties. He recently posted a slew of confusing TikToks addressing incidents of hazing involving <a href=#>Navarro College</a>. They appear to be in response to some alleged lying by fellow cheerleader Gabi Butler. We think.</p><p>So, what's with all of the Navarro drama? It's nothing to <a href=#>Cheer</a> about.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Evidently there was hazing at Navarro College that involved blackface.</h2><p>Unfortunately, there has been a lot of back-and-forth in this story. We've made a valiant effort to get to the bottom of it and start at the beginning, but the TikToks are flowing like wine.</p><p>To the best of our ability, we believe all this started on Dec. 13, 2022 when, in a series of now-deleted tweets, Gabi claimed to not know what <a href=#>blackface</a> was as it pertained to the hazing of cheerleaders at Navarro College.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Three days later, La'Darius responded with a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok of his own</a> claiming that "Gabi called and requested he say this." It appears as if La'Darius veered off-script. He addressed a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hazing video he posted the day before</a>, wherein Navarro cheerleaders are holding hands in a line and being led down a dark, rainy sidewalk while wearing white T-shirts on their heads. La'Darius is in the back and did not continue to participate.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@ladarius_marshall17 href=#>@ladarius_marshall17</a><p>Here is my truth that Gabi called me and requested to say. I do not lie and wonâ€™t lie for friends at all. She knew bc I told her end of discussion. If you were warmed before hand of their hazing why not say no? We talked about how you heard of the hazing before you even went to Navarro so Iâ€™m confused as to how this couldnâ€™t have been prevented when I said something. Only 3 athletes showed up with paint. So Iâ€™m confused? No one consented so donâ€™t lie on my name. TT is the rest of us so just @ him next time not us. <a title=done href=#>#Done</a></p><a title="â™¬ original sound - ðŸ‘‘LaDIDIðŸ‘‘" href=#>â™¬ original sound - ðŸ‘‘LaDIDIðŸ‘‘</a></figure><p>"My video was from July 2017, when we went to camp," La'Darius said. Apparently, the <a href=#>hazing</a> started immediately. Then, in March 2018 while at Navarro, Gabi rejoined the squad, which is when she put on blackface. So, there are now two hazing situations. One is Gabi wearing blackface and the other is members of the squad being forced to put T-shirts over their heads while at cheer camp in summer 2017. Whew.</p><p>What's frustrating La'Darius the most â€” and for very good reason â€” is that people are seemingly unaware of how blackface is racist. He explains that as the only Black person at Navarro, he was well aware of what was going on.</p><p>"The rest of these people have been living in Texas. They're used to it," he said. "Certain things are off limits," he explained. La'Darius also explicitly said that people wearing blackface was unacceptable.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Gabi clapped back, we think?</h2><p>Gabi took to Instagram Live to respond to La'Darius. Oh, by the way, La'Darius and Gabi dated at some point. He made sure to post a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok of them kissing</a> as proof. We feel compelled to include this information as there are undoubtedly some unresolved feelings in the mix.</p><p>OK, back to Gabi. In this rambling Instagram Live that was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">captured by Twitter user @Fashionistaws</a>, Gabi deflects and hurls insults at La'Darius, which is usually an indication of someone not being truthful.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I am not afraid of you, La'Darius Marshall. I am not afraid of you," claims Gabi, who is very worked up. She also says that La'Darius "running his mouth" doesn't affect her but the video suggests otherwise. Perhaps the most damning thing that Gabi does is say that she knows some secrets about La'Darius that she could spill, but claims that she's above that. (Normally that means someone doesn't actually have anything to say.) Gabi then ends the video by letting the world know she's Team Jesus. Does this mean she's cheering for Team Jesus?</p><p>La'Darius has since posted more TikToks about what happened at Navarro. He's also sort of replying to Gabi but at this point, please don't quote us. At the end of the day, wearing blackface is unacceptable and we hope that doesn't get lost in all the other Navarro drama. In the words of some wise influencer, "This could have been a text."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfo663rdGrpmabmJqys3nDq5immQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-young-industrial-designer.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Michael Young (industrial designer) net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./m25-crash-van-fire-traffic-updates.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>M25 crash: Van bursts into flames on motorway with massive traffic delays after road blocked The</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

While some <a href=#>Bridgerton</a> fans fell in love with the Netflix dramas’s chaste courtship traditions, many viewers <a href=#>just couldn’t stop talking about those steamy sex scenes</a> — including the cast.</p><p>“I love [Daphne’s] coming-of-age story and her sexual awakening. … My first-ever scene was in episode six, where Simon [<a href=#><strong>Regé-Jean Page</strong></a>] is going down on Daphne,” season 1 leading lady <a href=#><strong>Phoebe Dynevor</strong></a> revealed during an interview with Grazia UK in December 2020. “And it was so great, because it felt safe and fun: you choreograph it like a stunt or a dance. It’s crazy to me that that hasn’t been there in the past.”</p><p>Page, who played Daphne’s love interest, noted that he wasn’t expecting <a href=#>the widespread reaction to the hit Netflix series after it debuted</a> in December 2020.</p><p>“No one was sufficiently prepared. I wasn’t sufficiently prepared, and I was there,” he said during The Hollywood Reporter‘s Emmy Roundtable series in June 2021. “I think people were grateful for the intensity of the romantic aspects of Bridgerton; I’m not sure how grateful I was to watch it for myself. It was overwhelming. But I think people were looking to be overwhelmed.”</p><p>Ahead of season 2, showrunner <strong>Chris van Dusen</strong> opened up about <a href=#>taking the series in a new direction</a> when it came to those graphic love scenes.</p><p>“It was never about quantity for us,” the creator told reporters in March 2022. “Our approach to intimacy on the show really is the same as season 1. And we use these intimate scenes to tell a story and to push the story forward. We’ve never done a sex scene for the sake of doing a sex scene, and I don’t think we ever will.”</p><p>Dusen added: “It all serves a larger purpose and it’s a different story this season. It’s different characters. We’re with Anthony (<a href=#><strong>Jonathan Bailey</strong></a>) and Kate (<a href=#><strong>Simone Ashley</strong></a>) most of the [second] season and that’s very different from Daphne and Simon. And that’s really part of the draw to me of a project like this, the ability to tell these close-ended love stories of different characters season after season.”</p><p>Ashley, for her part, defended the decision to focus on emotional intimacy over sex scenes. “It makes sense for these characters because they’re so protective over their families and they’re so truthful to their duties and responsibilities — so for them to break that wouldn’t have made sense for the characters,” the Sex Education star said at the time. “And as Chris has said, they aren’t performative sex scenes or intimate scenes. They have a meaning behind them and I think it’s very earned when the fireworks happen.”</p><p>For Bailey, <a href=#>the heavy chemistry and tension meant more</a> when it came to Kate and Anthony’s slow burn story.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I think Kate and Anthony feel explicit in the way that they feel naked in front of each other. I think that’s also a very interesting, cerebral way of exploring that innate sexuality, and I think it bodes really well for the following seasons, to not just be about sex,” the U.K. native shared during the press conference. “That is a huge part of it, but there are so many other amazing things that are explored and will be explored going forward.”</p><p>Scroll down for the steamiest Bridgerton moments throughout the seasons:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BXv6qwxp6praeeqHq0wMSapKKdo6l6tLHXZqqcnZ6awG7Ax6umrp%2BYpMK1edOhnGarlZbAsLrSaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./charles-cullen.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Charles Cullen</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./blac-chyna-and-derrick-milano-make-their-relationship-official.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Blac Chyna and Derrick Milano Make Their Relationship Official</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

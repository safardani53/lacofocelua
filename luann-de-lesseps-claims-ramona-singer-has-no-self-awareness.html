In the photo, she’s posing in front of a fireplace in Beaver Creek, Colorado. Hanging above the mantle is a Native American portrait.</p><p>“Have you no self-awareness😮,” de Lesseps, 58, commented on the post, which garnered a slew of replies from followers. Comments on the post have since been limited, but the ones that are visible are split in terms of Singer’s photo.</p><p>De Lesseps’ comment comes in the wake of Singer’s <a href=#>N-word scandal</a>. Singer, who was a RHONY cast member from 2008 to 2021, was named in an October 2022 <a href=# rel=noopener>Vanity Fair</a> exposé about Bravo. In the article, she was accused of using the N-word in conversation with a Black crew member. The incident apparently occurred during the filming of Real Housewives: Ultimate Girls Trip: <a href=#>RHONY Legacy</a>, which premiered last month.</p><p>Singer appeared to use the word a second time while texting a <a href=# rel=noopener>Page Six</a> reporter about the claims made against her, according to screenshots of the apparent messages. Following the scandal, Singer’s name was removed from the list of BravoCon attendees and <a href=#>she was not present</a> at the three-day November 2023 convention in Las Vegas. (Singer’s daughter, Avery, 28, did <a href=#>make an appearance</a> at the event.)</p><p>At the time, a source told Us Weekly that Singer <a href=#>was “very upset”</a> over the entire situation.</p><p>“She’s <a href=#>been distraught</a>,” the insider added. “She will lay low right now.”</p><p>The initial source claimed it was a “mutual decision” between Singer and Bravo that she wouldn’t attend the fan convention. “Ultimately, she made the choice that she didn’t want to go, and Bravo thought it was a good idea given everything going on,” the source added.</p><p>A second insider told Us that the network did make the final decision about her appearance. “Ramona was told she is not coming to BravoCon,” the source shared. “It was not her choice to not attend.”</p><p>While Singer has become one of the most controversial RHONY alums over the years, De Lesseps has also had her moments in the past. Some fans raised eyebrows at her Instagram comment, citing her 2017 Halloween costume which was showcased during the RHONY season 10 premiere.</p><p>At the time, de Lesseps dressed up as <strong>Diana Ross</strong>, and was accused of blackface — accusations <a href=#>which she denied</a>.</p><p>“I’m horrified!” she said during a 2018 episode of Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen. “I never meant to hurt anybody’s feelings. I love Diana Ross and I totally respect Diana Ross. It was really kind of a tribute to her, and it was Halloween.”</p><p>She added, “I had bronzer on that I wear normally like the rest of my skin. I’m tan, like right now. So, I didn’t add anything to or would ever, ever, ever dream of doing a blackface, ever. I’m very sorry to everyone out there if I offended anyone.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She also apologized in a social media statement at the time.</p><p>“I would like to clear the air, I love and respect Diana Ross, this was my tribute to her I was showing my sincere admiration,” she shared via X (formerly Twitter). “I in no way altered my skin color and I did not mean to offend anyone.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalrZGju26wxGajnqujmr20ecKlmKKlo2K%2FornOp5hmq5mjtKa%2BjKGYrGWepHq0scufZJqvkaeyr7HSrGY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./thalia-sodis-tips-for-her-eylure-false-eyelash-and-eyebrow-collection.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Thalia Sodis Tips for Her Eylure False Eyelash and Eyebrow Collection</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jwoww-puts-fake-boobs-hair-extensions-on-daughter-funny-or-too-f.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>JWoww Puts Fake Boobs, Hair Extensions on Daughter: Funny or Too Far?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

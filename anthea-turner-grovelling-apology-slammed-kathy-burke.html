You're putting my health at risk!"</p><p>Amid the backlash, Anthea, 60, apologised and called the cartoon "clumsy".</p><p>She wrote: "Totally apologies (sic) that the cartoon is clumsy - I’ll take the rollicking on the chin. But this was never directed at people clinically ill who need our support. My passion is sincere though Covid has to give us a bloody big health wakeup call and we’d be nuts not to try and fix it."</p><p>But Gimme Gimme Gimme star Kathy wasn't having it and said: "How do you know who’s clinically ill or not?

Have you lost your mind, Anthea? Just despicable."</p><p>Labour MP Jess Phillips waded into the row, posting: "The Anthea Turner thing this morning has just about done me in. I just wish the idiots would just admit that the wind on their face is more important than my sister in laws life while she has chemo. Stop with the god damn hierarchy of whose life matters!!!"</p><p>Piers retweeted it, endorsing the message.</p><p>Another follower wrote: "Disgusting. Be ashamed.

How dare you!</p><p>One more questioned: "Why would you post something like this?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000614264121.jpg><p>There were some who agreed with the post though. One of Anthea's followers shared: "I agree with you.. to an extent .. but genuine question if the obese women was replaced by a skinny women stood there with a heroin needle in her hand would you still post this? Genuinely curious."</p><p>To which Anthea responded: "I feel the same - We have to take responsibility and stop using the NHS as sticking plaster."</p><p>Yesterday Anthea shared a Guardian report that obesity is a bigger killer in England and Scotland than smoking.</p><p>She then claimed that fit and healthy people like her were being punished in the pandemic for the actions of those who are less so.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>You're blaming 120,000+ covid deaths on the victims being lazy?<br>What a repellent, dumb & grotesquely offensive attitude.<br>Shame on you. <a href=#>https://t.co/LBMT4pgaAF</a></p>— Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) <a href=#>February 12, 2021</a><p>"Sadly those of us who have genuinely tried to protect the NHS by looking after our bodies are paying the terrible price for those who have chosen lazy lifestyle choices," she said.</p><p>Once again, Piers was outraged by her remarks, firing back: "You're blaming 120,000+ Covid deaths on the victims being lazy? What a repellent, dumb and grotesquely offensive attitude. Shame on you."</p><p>In the autumn a scientific report found obesity and social inequality were two driving factors for coronavirus deaths.</p><p>The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study published in The Lancet, found that being overweight or obese is linked to four out of five of the biggest risk factors for death in the UK, including&nbsp;diabetes, bad diet and&nbsp;high blood pressure.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000606736031.jpg><p>What's more having a high body mass index (BMI) is a contributing factor to two of the five leading causes of death in 2019.</p><p>And the researchers warn many of these conditions including obesity, diabetes and heart disease, significantly increase a person's risk of serious illness or death from Covid-19.</p><p>Dr Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of The Lancet, said: "One lesson of this pandemic is that it is not a simple pandemic.</p><p>"In fact, it's a synthesis of at least two epidemics - a coronavirus, and an epidemic of non-communicable diseases on a background of poverty and inequality."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>He added: "Non-communicable diseases have played a critical role in driving the more than one million deaths caused by Covid-19 to date, and will continue to shape health in every country after the pandemic subsides.</p><p>"As we address how to regenerate our health systems in the wake of Covid-19, this Global Burden of Disease Study offers a means of targeting where the need is greatest, and how it differs between countries."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>One in three adults in the UK are overweight or obese, with 20 per cent of kids leaving primary school obese.</p><p>The number of obese adults soared from 6.9 million in 1997 to around 13 million in 2017, according to Diabetes UK.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Celebrity SAS star Ant Middleton cruelly calls Anthea Turner, 59, 'grandma'</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hqY2eAd36VaJinrJiarm7A1KulnqpdnL%2BwwsSlo6Kml2KusbvLqJ6yZaOhrq65xJ1kpJmkncZurtSrop5n</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lorenzo-neal.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Lorenzo Neal net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./wnfdycy9hgoynzp81dramcj1ustq0abn.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Scream 3 - Watch Full Movie on Paramount Plus</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

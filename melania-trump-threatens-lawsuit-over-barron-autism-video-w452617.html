Harder says,<b>&nbsp;“</b><span>The video regarding Barron Trump has been removed, and the person who posted it has retracted it and apologized for it, at the same YouTube page.”</span></p><p><b>UPDATE 11/28 8:48 p.m. ET</b>: The YouTube user who posted the original video speculating that <b>Barron Trump</b> may be autistic is going to remove the video and issue an apology. “I’ve been in contact with <b>Melania Trump</b>‘s lawyer,” YouTube user <a href=#>James Hunter shared Monday evening.</a> “This video will be deleted in 24 hours and I will publish a full retraction and apology to Melania and Barron Trump.” Hunter also revealed via his YouTube page that he meant no harm towards Barron and that he personally suffers from autism.</p><p>“I never ever meant this as a bullying video,” Hunter wrote. “As someone who was diagnosed at age 5 and has gone through bullying myself, I would NEVER do something like that. I made this because I truly believed Barron was on the spectrum, and I wanted people to stop bullying him over his ‘weird’ behavior and explain to them that it might actually be due to a condition. … I have a great respect for [Melania] and her family. I never meant to hurt anyone.”</p><p><i>Original story continues below</i></p><p><b>Melania Trump</b> is threatening to sue over the <a href=#>YouTube video that suggests her son,&nbsp;<b>Barron Trump</b>, may be autistic.</a> In a statement to <i>Us Weekly,</i> Melania’s lawyer Charles J. Harder says the video is a form of harassment and bullying.</p><p>“This law firm represents First Lady–elect Melania Trump and her 10-year-old son, Barron Trump. A video was posted at YouTube recently speculating that Barron might be autistic. He is not,” Harder of Harder Mirell & Abrams LLP in Los Angeles tells <i>Us</i> of the seven-minute video, which features footage of Barron from various moments throughout the campaign.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“The video includes the hashtag ‘StopTheBullying’ but yet the video itself is bullying by making false statements and speculation about a 10-year-old boy for the purpose of harassing him and his parents,” Harder continues. “The online bullying of children, including Barron Trump, should end now.”</p><p><a href=#>According to TMZ</a>, the law firm also mentioned <b>Rosie O’Donnell</b> in a letter regarding the video, which was shared by the comedian via Twitter November 21. As previously reported, O’Donnell, who has a contentious history with President-elect <b>Donald Trump</b>, tweeted, “Barron Trump Autistic? If so — what an amazing opportunity to bring attention to the AUTISM epidemic,” along with a link to the clip.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After facing backlash online, <a href=#>O’Donnell clarified on her website</a> that she didn’t mean any ill will toward the child and that her own 3-year-old daughter, Dakota, was diagnosed with high-functioning autism this past September. O’Donnell wrote that she only shared the video thinking that if it were true, then it “would help so much with the autism epidemic.”</p><p>According to the letter obtained by TMZ, Melania isn’t threatening O’Donnell with a lawsuit; Harder wants the YouTube user who posted the original video to delete it and apologize.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamnZyWu6qtjK2prqWgYsGpvsSaq56mo2K5osPSrqCtZZ%2BrsrN5wZqpq6eeYq62wMispGaumZmysHnWbWxrbmFsfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bree-turner-is-living-happily-with-her-husband-justin-saliman-and-children-know-in-details.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bree Turner is Living Happily With her Husband Justin Saliman and Children, Know in Details</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-julia-ma-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Julia Ma Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

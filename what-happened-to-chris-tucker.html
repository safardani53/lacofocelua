Back in the '90s, he was rising to fame and landed his breakout role in Def Comedy Jam on HBO. Due to the hilarity of his stand-up comedy routines, he earned tons of praise from audiences who wanted to continue seeing him tell his perfectly timed jokes.</p><p>He stayed with Def Jam Comedy from 1992 to 1997. After making a name for himself there, he snagged roles in movies like House Party 3 and Friday. He even was granted an MTV Movie Award nomination for Best Breakthrough Performance for the latter. When Chris was cast in Rush Hour opposite <a href=#>Jackie Chan</a>, his career was at an all-time high.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>It premiered in1998, and it was the year everybody knew his name. Since Rush Hour was such a hit, two sequels were released in 2001 and 2007. Fast forward to 2012, and Chris was invited to start in Silver Linings Playbook alongside <a href=#>Jennifer Lawrence</a> and <a href=#>Bradley Cooper</a>. In 2015, he signed a deal with Netflix for his own stand-up special called Chris Tucker: Live.</p><p>His jokes were way less raunchy and inappropriate than they had been in the past, but his fans were still excited to see him back on stage performing. In 2019, rumors about a fourth Rush Hour movie started making their rounds, but nothing amounted from those passing conversations. Chris has been keeping it low-key for a while now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGScoKKewG7A1Jyinqo%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./celebs-go-datings-kimberley-hart-simpson-visits-shag-pad.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Celebs Go Datings Kimberley Hart Simpson takes Dream Boy Shane to mansion's 'shag-pad' - and jump</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mot-tester-finds-python-under-car.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>MoT tester left in shock after finding 3ft python under a bonnet</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

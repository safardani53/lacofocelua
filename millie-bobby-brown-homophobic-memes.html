Get all the details on the drama here.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Online bullying has been a serious issue for decades now, even amongst people we tend to think of as being above all Twitter drama. Several celebrities have been driven off social media channels for brief periods ‚Äî or even forever ‚Äî due to harassment, such as Saturday Night Live's Leslie Jones and The Last Jedi actress Kelly Marie Tran.</p><p>There are too many Twitter trolls to call out on the world wide web, but a large number of them seem to thoroughly enjoy accusing Stranger Things actress <a href=#>Millie Bobby Brown</a> of being homophobic. It all started with a meme, which caused her to delete her Twitter account at the time. Now, the accusations are back, and they're worse than ever.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Millie Bobby Brown's latest homophobia accusations are due to a simple misunderstanding.</h2><p>Millie's latest homophobia accusations are baseless because of something taken out of context. The teen actress was apparently recorded saying something that sounded like the "d-slur," which describes lesbian women in a hateful way. Twitter responded to this immediately, calling her a homophobe, and saying that she was officially 'canceled.'</p><p>However, that wasn't the case. Twitter user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@levelofthehype</a>, brought to light that Millie was simply combining the names of her co-stars in Stranger Things, Dustin and Mike, to name a non-existent ship. We don't know why this came up, but it seemed completely innocent. See the full explanation below.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">As previously mentioned, this wasn't Millie's first time of being baselessly accused of homophobia.</h2><p>A few years back in 2018, a hateful and slanderous meme came to light that ended with Millie deactivating her Twitter account, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to</a> Vox. The tweets originated in the gay community, accusing Millie of being homophobic after a girl <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> that the actress allegedly attacked her in an airport for wearing a hijab.&nbsp;</p><p>This accusation seemed almost far too ridiculous to be real, so Twitter started making spinoffs, depicting Millie as a racist homophobe, but the memes were just as hateful as the original accusation, although they weren't true. See a few examples below.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Millie bobby Brown when a gay fan asks to take a picture with her <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/eEVz8KjIU5</a></p>‚Äî addie (@addyeet) <a href=#>June 10, 2018</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>the gays after millie bobby brown runs them over <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/V6iTPYaJfS</a></p>‚Äî ‚ú∞ kristen ‚ú∞ (@hausofaquaria) <a href=#>June 12, 2018</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Millie Bobby Brown pointing up to heaven where the gays WONT be going &lt;3 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/vQ4YIwGpWJ</a></p>‚Äî cass (@mohchwa) <a href=#>June 12, 2018</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>it's time to share my story. one day i saw millie bobby brown in the mall and i asked for a selfie and she said "i don't take selfies with fags, homo sex is sin" and broke my iphone X. i couldn't stop crying i'm so ashamed. <a href=#>#TakeDownMillieBobbyBrown</a></p>‚Äî bash (@HlGHPRlNCESS) <a href=#>November 18, 2017</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>millie bobby brown: can y‚Äôall stop saying im homophobic?</p><p>Gay twitter: <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Oiigv1gCFz</a></p>‚Äî fatass kelly price (@magaaylaa) <a href=#>June 13, 2018</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Some begun to recognize that memes were harmful and slanderous.</h2><p>As we said, these memes ended with Millie leaving Twitter for good, which is sad, if you think about it.

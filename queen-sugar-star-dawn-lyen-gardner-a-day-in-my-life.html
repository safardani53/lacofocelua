Queen Sugar star&nbsp;<strong>Dawn-Lyen&nbsp;Gardner</strong>&nbsp;is a busy woman, but she still makes time for herself.</p><p>The actress, 40, has played leading lady Charley Bordelon West on the OWN series — currently in its sixth season — <a href=#>since its debut in September 2016</a>. The show, which is based on <strong>Natalie Baszile</strong>’s 2014 novel of the same name, follows three siblings in rural Louisiana who must decide what to do with their father’s sugarcane farm after his sudden death.</p><p>Creator <a href=#><strong>Ava DuVernay</strong></a> implemented an initiative to <a href=#>only use female directors on the show from the beginning</a>, which set a positive tone.</p><p>“It has been actually pretty game-changing,”&nbsp;Gardner&nbsp;explained during a February appearance on <a href=#>The Real</a>. “Working with all women directors for five years of my life, it actually fully shifted just the definition of a director. Ava was the first woman director I ever worked with in television, and then it was sort of 34 women after that. It has really completely transformed what was possible even for myself, I think, on some level as an actor, just seeing who’s at the helm, seeing who’s in leadership — all of that informs, I guess, a permission that you give yourself to more fully embody yourself, to more fully embody the work, and your own dreams of perhaps one day doing that for yourself.”</p><p>The directive not only changed&nbsp;Gardner’s life but also the field of television&nbsp;as a whole. “It really was an emotional shift for me, and I’m so, so grateful to the show and for Ava for that initiative,” she continued. “It was, I think, game-changing for me and for other actors, but it was definitely game-changing for the industry.”</p><p>The Juilliard graduate reflected on her character’s journey earlier this year. “What has emerged from her struggle with belonging is that she doesn’t wait for that space to be made — she makes it,” she told <a href=#>emmy magazine</a>. “And we watched that process, as she did it from a more authentic place, based in her connectedness rather than in self-service. It feels less fraught and more rooted now. Playing that has been such a delicious journey for me.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Gardner&nbsp;has plenty on her professional plate, but when she is not on set, she focuses on self-care and work-life balance, whether that is through a power nap, a workout, meditation or reading.</p><p>Want to see&nbsp;Gardner’s day in action?

The duo were backstage at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, where Kourtney’s husband, <a href=#><strong>Travis Barker</strong></a>, performed that night.</p><p>In the photo, the Lemme developer <a href=#>wore a Blink-182 T-shirt</a> under overalls, while the Selfish author flashed a peace sign and blew a kiss in the background. Kim, for her part, shared a behind-the-scenes snap of the sign above Barker’s dressing room before posting a video of the band on stage during their performance of “I Miss You.”</p><p>The Skims cofounder also shared a video of herself and Kourtney dancing to “All the Small Things” with friends <strong>Marni Senofonte</strong> and <strong>Harry Hudson</strong>.</p><p>The sisters’ posts came hours before the Thursday, May 25, premiere of season 3 of <a href=#>The Kardashians</a>, which documented the beginning of their feud over Kim’s collaboration with Dolce & Gabbana. The disagreement came about soon after <a href=#>Kourtney’s May 2022 nuptials</a> to Barker, 47. Throughout the duo’s Italian celebration weekend, the wellness guru and the drummer both wore D&G, as did the members of the Kardashian-Jenner family.</p><p>“My mom has known <strong>[Domenico] Dolce</strong> and <strong>[Stefano] Gabbana</strong> for a long time and they were always asking me — even before the wedding — if we could do a book,” Kim explained in the season premiere. “Kourtney and Travis just worked with Dolce and that was her whole vibe of her wedding. Then after the wedding, I got a call saying they wanted me to creative direct their fashion show in Milan. I think this is such a good opportunity that I don’t want to pass this up.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a> alum went on to say that she was worried about the collaboration happening so quickly after her older sister’s wedding day. “They want me to do a collection and design,” Kim added. “I think it is a little too soon after Kourtney’s wedding and I want to wait a year.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Kim-and-Kourtney-Kardashian-Hang-Out-at-Blink-182-Concert-as-Feud-Plays-Out-on-The-Kardashians-Inline.jpg><p>As fans know, however, Kim didn’t wait, debuting her collection with the brand in September 2022. The <a href=#>trailer for season 3</a> of The Kardashians hinted that this didn’t go over well with Kourtney, who accused her sister of using her wedding as a “business opportunity” with the Italian fashion house.</p><p>“People think that it’s a misunderstanding. It’s not,” Kourtney said in the teaser, which also showed members of her family weighing in on the drama.</p><p>Kim, for her part, argued that she tried to be “mindful” about the wedding when she began her partnership with D&G. “I’m really confused how this narrative came into her head,” the California native revealed. “I said, ‘Don’t do anything that Kourtney wore to her wedding.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Earlier this month, Kim said season 3 of the Hulu show was <a href=#>one of her most difficult to film</a> as tensions rose between her and Kourtney. “Out of filming <a href=#>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a> or The Kardashians, this season was probably my most emotional and frustrating internally with family that I haven’t really seen or experienced before,” she said during an appearance on the Today show.</p><p>When asked specifically about her relationship with Kourtney, Kim replied: “We’ve been there before and we’ll always be OK. We’re always family.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakoZ1iuLDB0a2lnrFdoK6zsMCsn6KZnmK1orrGZpitZZKhtq%2B3jGpva2WTpLuksdGtZJqepJq%2FbrLErpto</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./margie-ashcroft.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Margie Ashcroft</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kim-fields-sister-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kim Fields Is a Hero For Her Sister Alexis Fields</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

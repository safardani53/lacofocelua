Debra, his wife, broke the news. Hope Hines, sports director for NewsChannel 5, paid homage to Howard, writing:</p><p>“My heart is shattered. I just lost one of my closest friends. He was more like a son to me, and he felt the same way about me; I was a father figure to him in many respects. I’m devastated for Jack, his kid, and Debra. He had a fantastic talent.”</p><p>Howard’s funeral arrangements have not yet been made public.&nbsp;Mark Howard died on Sunday, although the cause of death was not disclosed. His family members have also yet to make a comment on the cause of his death.&nbsp;Despite the fact that NewsChannel5 announced his death, they did not reveal how he died. It is unclear whether Howard was suffering from any health problems. For the time being, it has been verified that Howard died at home rather than in a hospital.</p><h2>All About Mark Howard</h2><p>Mark Howard rose to prominence as a sports anchor on NewsChannel 5 at the age of 20. For 20 years, the West Hartford, Connecticut native worked for NewsChannel 5. He transitioned to radio as the host of a local political talk program before returning to sports as the co-anchor of the Wake-Up Zone radio show. He co-hosted the program with Kevin Ingram and Frank Wycheck on The Zone 104.5 FM. Ingram and Wychek will leave the program in 2020. At the time, Mark also said,</p><p>“It’s been a fantastic run. I and Kevin hosted the (Wake Up Zone) program for 16 years. They were some of the most enjoyable years of my life. “I have nothing but positive things to say about my experiences there.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Mark-Howard-2.jpg alt="Mark Howard" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Ingram said that Howard had a significant impact on him, which led him to The Zone. He claimed he enjoyed working with Howard and considered him a good friend. Mark, he claimed, was the only one who supported him and his work. He also stated:</p><p>“He was usually upbeat and offered sound advise.” There aren’t many individuals in the world who know more about sports than Mark. It was almost frightening how much he knew, particularly about baseball.”</p><p>Howard was a part-time host at The Game 102.5-FM until his death. He also hosted a postgame show for the Tennessee Titans and co-hosted the Predators’ pregame and postgame broadcasts.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Mark-Howard-3.jpg alt="Mark Howard" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>For his sports acumen and appearances on NewsChannel 5, Howard became a household name.

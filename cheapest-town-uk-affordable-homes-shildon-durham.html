"Someone actually lives in there. He never comes out, he daren't or they'd have him. He just sits all day and night behind the boarded up doors and windows.

But that means local people can't afford to get on the property ladder and all these people arriving from across the country means the sense of community has gone.</p><p>"I've lived here since I was eight and everybody knew each other. That's not the case any more.</p><p>"We've been forgotten and left behind. The Government and local authority have just left it to die away.</p><p>"We no longer have a school here. That closed down because the building was so neglected through being underfunded. The Shildon kids have to go to school in neighbouring towns now.

The most common were sexual and violent crimes.</p><p>Ella says most of the town's young people have the simple ambition to leave.</p><p>She said: "There's nothing to do for young people, the pubs are like going back in time to the Nineties and there's nothing on the high street except about 60 pizza shops.</p><p>"I don't work and I live with my Mam.

We're also exempt from business rates because the properties are worth so little.</p><p>"I am struggling at the moment, especially as the electricity bill is £802 a month, so it's just as well the rent is so low."</p><p>Her husband David, 39, also tries to remain positive, saying: "You can get two bottles of Newcastle Brown Ale for a fiver in The Royal George.”</p><p>"I lived in Shildon for 13 years before Claire and I moved to Newton Aycliffe, but I must admit I miss the place. It's a friendly town with a lot of really good people in it."</p><p>In the midst of the many boarded-up shops on the high street - including the town's Costa branch - is estate agent FJ Estates, where Geraldine Raw explains what has led to Shildon's house price slump in her view.</p><p>"It has to keep step with the level of benefits people get and in this part of County Durham it's very low," she said.</p><p>"I had a single woman under 35 in here recently who only got £282.44 a month towards her housing from Universal Credit.</p><p>"That means the house prices have to be low so that the private landlords who buy them can charge rents that people in the town can afford.</p><p>"We often sell through auction houses which attracts investors from London."</p><p>Councillor Peter Quin, a Shildon resident of 30 years and former mayor of the town, says the decline began "when the wagon works shut."</p><p>That was way back in 1984, with the loss of 1,750 jobs, a blow that the town once known as The Cradle of the Railways has never recovered from.</p><p>Peter says: "Prices are low here because there are a lot of Band A properties, houses built for workers from the railways and the mines, which are long since gone.</p><p>"Yes, the town has had a tough time and it's been up against it for years.</p><p>"But there's one thing they'll never take from us and that's the community spirit. People care about their friends and neighbours and if you're in trouble they'll look out for you. You can't put a price on that."</p><p>Peter said the councillors on Shildon Town Council came to a decision not to be paid allowances or expenses.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>He said: "If all 17 councillors were paid £1,000 each, that's £17,000 people have to fund through their taxes.</p><p>"We decided we didn't want that, we give our time willingly for the good of the town and that's how things work here, that's what community is all about."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/891777f2-f336-4acb-9878-182a0f398d92.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/e30cd1e7-17d7-4b21-b386-4db438e9630a.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ff6315ed-ffe9-4e09-b22d-9b1109ce3f99.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoV2gZRsbG5nk52yorzErKtmrJ%2Bsu27BymaYn56fp7GirsueZKGnnZrAbr%2FHoqOdp55isba%2Bx5qkaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./al-and-lisa-robertson-interview.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Al and Lisa Robertson Interview</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hailee-steinfeld-supports-boyfriend-josh-allen-at-buffalo-bills-game.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hailee Steinfeld Supports Boyfriend Josh Allen at Buffalo Bills Game</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

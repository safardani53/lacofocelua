Aches and pains</h2><p>Dr Susanna Unsworth, a gynaecology expert at&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Intima</a>, previously told Sun Health: “Having sex on your period has been proven to help relieve painful symptoms that can come with menstruation, from menstrual cramps to&nbsp;<a href=#>migraines</a>.</p><p>“This is because sex and orgasm can increase the production of chemicals that result in ‘wellbeing feelings’, which dampen pain signals and act as a form of pain relief.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Health</h2></p><p>This was echoed by sexologist Rebecca Alvarez Story, who told Well+Good that sex can remedy aches and pains caused by sore muscles and headaches.</p><p>So foregoing a romp might mean your aches and pains will hang around for a little longer.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. Anxiety</h2><p>Having sex can release a cocktail of endorphins - known as 'happy hormones' - into your body, including oxytocin and dopamine.</p><p>These can lower your stress levels and boost your mood, which is why fertility specialist and board-certified OB/GYN Lucky Sekhon told <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Well+Good</a> that “long-term dry spells may predispose [people] to depression, anxiety, and increased stress".</p><p>Some quality time between the sheets can also make you feel closer and more connected to your partner, so a lack of sex can also make you feel more unsure or anxious about the state of your relationship.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. Worse sleep</h2><p>There's a reason some people conk out after a sex sesh.</p><p>Rebecca said the the body releases a cocktail of hormones after experiencing intense pleasure during sex.</p><p>They include vasopressin and oxytocin, which reduce stress in your body and help you fall asleep quickly.</p><p>Norepinephrine and serotonin then help achieve deep sleep.</p><p>As a result, a lack of sex may lead to you having worse-quality sleep.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. Lower libido</h2><p>Do you ever notice that you crave sex more when you're regularly having it?</p><p>There's research to support this, with a small 2014 published in <a aria-label="The Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality</a> finding that people who engaged in sex were more likely to crave a romp the <span id=cce2a41b-d225-49c7-85f2-03fa5bb810af class=suggested-link>next</span> day.</p><p>Sexologist Carol Queen told Well+Good that the opposite can happen during a dry spell, where your body almost gets out of the habit of needing sex or responding to arousing stimuli.</p><p>“For some, this will have the effect that it becomes harder to get turned on, even if you want to," she explained.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. Putting on weight</h2><p>Like any physical activity, sex does burn some calories.</p><p><a aria-label="WebMD (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WebMD</a> said you can burn about five calories per minute during a typical sesh, about as much as you would with a brisk walk.</p><p>Though this may not seem like much, it starts to add up over the long term.</p><p>So it might mean that you gain a few pounds during a dry spell - this is especially the case if you're not supplementing the lack of sexual activity with other things.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6. Dryness and tears</h2><p>Obstetrician Dr Ali Novitsky, founder of Exercising Intimacy, told The Telegraph that after&nbsp;menopause, a woman's vagina can become tighter and her vaginal tissues thinner if she doesn't have sex regularly.</p><p>This can make you more susceptible to injury, tears or bleeding down there when you have sex.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>7. Erectile dysfunction</h2><p>Men who have sex less than once a week are twice as likely to have&nbsp;<a href=#>erectile dysfunction&nbsp;</a>(ED) as those who have it weekly, according to WebMD.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>8. Loss of clitoral sensation</h2><p>The clitoris can be incredibly sensitive and responsive, but prolonged periods of abstinence can make it temporarily shrink and lose sensation.</p><p>This is called&nbsp;clitoral atrophy, and it’s commonly caused by a lack of blood flow to and stimulation of the clitoris.</p><p>Luckily, this is isn't permanent.</p><p>“As you engage in sexual activity more often, the vagina gains elasticity, the body gets used to being touched, and the clitoris regains feeling," Tara Suwinyattichaiporn, a sex and relationships expert, told Well+Good.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>9. High blood pressure</h2><p>Sex can benefit your cardiovascular system, especially if your sessions are particularly aerobic.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>If you're not supplementing the lack of activity between the sheets with other activities that can keep your blood pressure down, you might see your levels rise.</p><p>This can be a vicious cycle, as men with high blood pressure sometimes experience problems getting or keeping an erection that's hard enough for sex, according to <a href=# aria-label="Blood Pressure UK (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blood Pressure UK</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57x56YpayYZIZ6fpRqbXBnp52utXnCmqVmoJGlvaa6jJumnbFdqMGwvIyhmK%2Bhnpx6tLHXaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./murray-head-was-rushed-to-hospital-after-his-car-was-struck-by-the-truck.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Murray Head Was Rushed To Hospital After His Car Was Struck By The Truck</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ariana-biermann-slammed-by-fans-for-racy-bikini-pics.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Slammed By Fans For Racy Bikini Pics</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

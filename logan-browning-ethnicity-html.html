She was later adopted by&nbsp;African American&nbsp;parents.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>However, she&nbsp;was not much bothered about her ethnicity or cared&nbsp;about being judged. Instead, she&nbsp;did a lot of activities while growing up, including&nbsp;dancing for a local ballet company and&nbsp;cheerleading in junior high. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Logan Browning Speaks about Parents and Ethnicity</h2><p>Since finding her voice, thanks to her popularity,&nbsp;Browning has occasionally made the most of the opportunities to speak up about her parents'&nbsp;impact on her life, her ethnicity, and identity.</p><p>For instance, while <a href=# rel="follow noopener">speaking with Refinery29</a> in August 2018, she explained why she didn't prefer to be described as biracial instead of just a black&nbsp;person.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>"My first answer is: 'My parents are Black,'" she told the publication. "Part of the reason I say that is because I want to help shift people’s ideas of different ethnicities, thinking that they all have to look the same." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She further stated that she should also not be called biracial because&nbsp;she has&nbsp;light eyes. "I can still have Black parents," Browning added.</p><p>The same year, she also sat down for a conversation&nbsp;on the headline-making radio show <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Breakfast Club</a>. There, she revealed that she was adopted, while talking about her folks&nbsp;and ethnicity.</p><p>The actress said that she saw herself as being from a black ethnicity while growing up. Moreover, she was not raised in a biracial household; hence, she didn't think and call herself&nbsp;biracial. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>"I think of myself as Black — because that's what I am. But for some people, I guess the confusing part happens, really, when I have to explain that to them," she explained.</p><p></p><p><strong>Logan Browning posted a throwback picture with her mother in July 2021.</strong> (Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>During the long chat, she even unveiled that she had&nbsp;never met her biological parents. Because of that, she felt there was a part of her identity outside of her ethnicity she still didn't know.</p><p>"But I don’t see myself as any different," she later added.</p><h2>The Rise of Logan Browning as an Actress</h2><p>All that being said, the actress has come a long way from Atlanta, where she was raised by her adoptive parents. She also&nbsp;attended Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Besides, she initially started acting at the age of 14 and subsequently&nbsp;took up her first major role in 2007. She portrayed one of the main characters, Sasha, in the live-action theatrical feature Bratz: The Movie, based on the popular fashion doll line.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Browning was then roped in to play a role in Meet the Browns during the second season, replacing Brianne Gould as the character Brianna Ortiz.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>But her best of projects came in the 2010s, where she starred in movies and TV shows such as&nbsp;The Secret Circle, Hit the Floor, <a href=# rel=follow>The Perfection</a>, and Dear White People. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In the latter project —&nbsp;satirical-drama series Dear White People —&nbsp;she played the lead character of Samantha White who is a college student trying to wake people up to social issues. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKSfnK6vecGrprCmmaO0brHToaWim5mpxm%2B006aj</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./christina-ruffini.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Christina Ruffini net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./celebrities-lingerie-halloween-costumes-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Celebrities in Lingerie for Halloween Costumes: Photos Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

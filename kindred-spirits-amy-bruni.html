Instead of being scared of her home, she and her family embraced it, and because of her father's ghost-sleuthing skills, she became interested in investigating paranormal activity herself. But before she became a professional ghost hunter, she worked in health insurance for a decade.</p><p>She eventually quit the health insurance industry to pursue her true passion, and got a job as a professional paranormal activity researcher. She traveled across the U.S. looking into specific cases, and eventually joined the Atlantic Paranormal Society.</p><p>The founders, Grant Wilson and Jason Haws, started Ghost Hunters, which she eventually became a part of. After that, she became a producer of the podcast, Beyond Reality Radio. In 2019, she published her book, Life With the Afterlife: 13 Truths I Learned About Ghosts.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Amy Bruni married?</h2><p>Amy Bruni is married to a guy she refers to as "Mr. X." The two have a daughter together named Charlotte, who was born in 2012. We don't know much about Mr. X, only that his real name is supposedly Jimmy, and that he served in the military at some point. Mysterious!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Amy's other ventures also include her own business: a boutique paranormal travel company called <a href=# rel=nofollow>Strange Escapes</a>. You can visit the website to find out more on how you can plan a weekend trip based around haunted houses and events.</p><p>The site explains: "Every Strange Escapes event will feature in depth investigations of some of the largest, most haunted locations in the United States. Plus, lectures from paranormal notables, television personalities, authors and more. You will shake their hands, pick their brains, and perhaps even sit down to dinner with them. You will learn and see things you never knew were possible, and you will leave knowing that you’re not alone in your beliefs."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>These days, when Amy isn't chasing ghosts, she's probably hanging out with her adorable family.</p><p>Watch the Season 5 premiere of Kindred Spirits on Travel Channel tonight at 10 p.m. EST.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoLavsNGem2aroJ6%2FqsDSZpimsV2Xv7a6yA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./drew-jacobs.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Drew Jacobs</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-danny-langsdorf-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Danny Langsdorf Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

It can be accompanied by distension, which is a widening of the waist, and wind.</p><p><a href=#>Bloating </a>may be the result of abnormal or slow digestion, or <span id=3cfc6ace-5855-4d04-a450-f6a3e77d6e5b class=suggested-link>gas</span> getting stuck.</p><p>While we associate it with eating too much, Dr Cooke tells Sun Health: “Bloating over the festive period can be caused by a few different things.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE HEALTH NEWS">READ MORE HEALTH NEWS</h2><p>“Often a change in routine can impact our digestion.</p><p>“Eating regular meals with <a href=#>fibre </a>– fruits and vegetables are important – and drinking water alongside alcoholic beverages helps.</p><p>“Regular movement aids digestion too, so embrace <a href=#>winter</a> walks.</p><p>“Certain foods such as cabbage, sprouts and broccoli are known to cause slightly more wind, which isn’t harmful but can be uncomfortable.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Health</h2></p><p>“Fizzy drinks can also cause bloating, so try to limit these.”</p><p>Dr Matthew adds: “Ginger contains an enzyme called zingibain, which helps food to be digested more easily and so reduces the amount of gas produced.”</p><p>Ground or grated ginger can be added to a hot tea in the morning to try to prevent bloating.</p><p>Dr Matthew adds: “Charcoal powder tablets absorb excess gas in the gut by trapping gas molecules.</p><p>“Asparagus, which could be added to meals, not only helps ‘good bacteria’ in your gut but also helps you urinate and so avoid a bloated bladder, too.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>FEEL THE BURN</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/bh5hc3-woman-chest-pain-867340140.jpg><p>THERE are an estimated 13,200 visits to the <a href=#>NHS</a> heartburn and acid reflux page during Christmas Day and<a href=#> <span id=748e5a92-2b95-4210-8442-3f4df830015c class=suggested-link>Boxing</span> Day</a> – equivalent to one view every 13 seconds.</p><p>Heartburn happens when the muscle that helps push food from the oesophagus to the stomach doesn’t work properly, allowing stomach acid to travel up the oesophagus and cause irritation.</p><p>For instant relief, Dr Matthew says an alkaline – bananas or a teaspoon of baking soda in water – can help.</p><p>Dr Matthew tells Sun Health: “Chewing gum can also stimulate saliva production, which when swallowed can neutralise acid.”</p><p>Physio Nell Mead says stretching the diaphragm can help relieve pressure on the oesophagus and get food moving down.</p><p>She says: “Take a gentle breath into the bottom of your lungs, then breathe out as far as you can and add a hold – hold your nose, close your mouth, and see how long you can go before you breathe in.</p><p>“Try to build up to holding for 30 seconds, making sure you’re holding at the end of the out breaths when your diaphragm is really stretched.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>GALE FORCE</h2><p>SPROUTS, broccoli, cabbage... you have probably had your fair share of wind-inducing foods over Christmas.</p><p>So lay off these cruciferous vegetables for now if you are having trouble with excess wind.</p><p>Dr Cooke advises: “Try to avoid eating meals quickly as this can exacerbate it.</p><p>“Aim to eat regular meals rather than constant snacking. Gentle exercise can also help.”</p><p>If you can’t bear to get off the sofa just yet, drink some peppermint tea, which Dr Cooke says can help calm digestive symptoms, and limit fizzy drinks.</p><p>If it’s trapped wind you’ve got difficulties with, Dr Matthew says: “Applying heat to the area can relax any bowel spasms allowing gas to pass.</p><p>“If it’s not too painful then gentle exercise can help the excess wind move along the bowel.</p><p>“One great combination for relaxing and mild exertion is trying some yoga, which can help you find a pose that will ease your symptoms.</p><p>“For example, the Apanasana pose where you lie on your back or side and draw your knees back and forth into your chest.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>GOOD STUFFING</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/tayey3-fennel-seeds-bowl-wooden-867339925-1.jpg><p>SOMETIMES stuffing your face causes pain, so much so it is difficult to breathe.</p><p>But the worst thing you can do is give into the temptation to lie down, according to experts.</p><p>Dr Matthew says: “Releasing the pressure in the GI system can help, so loosen your clothing and find a more upright comfortable position.</p><p>“Taking antispasmodics will stop your bowel from cramping – peppermint and ginger are two excellent antispasmodics and can be taken in tablet form or as part of a tea.</p><p>“Fennel seeds can also relax gastrointestinal spasms. Over-the-counter Buscopan and Mebeverine will do the same job.”</p><p>In the <span id=4128e089-1d83-4b85-8325-8143d7ae0cec class=suggested-link>next</span> few days, avoid <a href=#>overeating </a>by recognising the subtle signs that you are already full to prevent feeling uncomfortable.</p><p>Dr Cooke says: “When you’re starting to feel full during eating, place your cutlery down and have a drink – water ideally – and take a break for a minute or so.</p><p>“This helps your brain to recognise you’re starting to feel full.</p><p>“If you have overindulged and are feeling uncomfortable, then a gentle walk can help.</p><p>“And remove snacks and other foods away from your eye line (off the Christmas coffee table) so you’re not tempted to continue eating.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>ALL BUNGED UP</h2><p>USING the toilet less often than usual is the main sign you’re suffering with <a href=#>constipation</a>.</p><p>The medically used Bristol Stool Chart says you are constipated if your poo is in separate hard lumps that are difficult to pass or a lumpy sausage shape.</p><p>Other signs are not completely emptying your bowels or straining when you go.</p><p>Dr Cooke says: “The change in routine or staying away from home can alter bowel habits.”</p><p>Other causes include not eating enough fibre, being too sedentary or stressed. Dr Cooke adds: “Constipation can be helped by making sure you’re hydrated.</p><p>“Regular movement such as walking and increasing your fibre intake with lots of fruit and veg will help too.”</p><p>It’s easy to graze on leftovers, but try to slowly introduce normal foods again.</p><p>“Beans and pulses are a great source of fibre, so try adding lentils to soups or chickpeas to a curry,” Dr Cooke suggests.</p><p>Alternatively, try porridge with fruit for breakfast, beans on whole-meal bread for lunch or a root vegetable salad.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>LEFTOVER DANGER</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/pure-pleasure-thirsty-millennial-female-867496656.jpg><p>YOU will likely pick at some leftovers during the next few days.</p><p>But watch out – food that is not reheated thoroughly, refrigerated properly or been out for too long can lead to food poisoning, which causes vomiting, diarrhoea and stomach cramps.</p><p>Anyone can get it – but be aware that the over-65s, children and those with chronic conditions that weaken the immune system are at greater risk of falling victim to food poisoning.</p><p>Pregnant women are also more likely to get sick from germs.#</p><p>While food poisoning is not usually serious and can be over within one to two days, it can be life-threatening if severe dehydration occurs.</p><p>Dr Cooke says: “Hydration is key if you have food poisoning.</p><p>“Small sips of water or diluted <span id=adf5597b-eb5d-4d40-b82c-f3b15450babd class=suggested-link>apple</span> juice can help keep you hydrated.</p><p>“Avoid large quantities in one go, though, as it can make you vomit.</p><p>“If you’re unable to keep anything down or have severe diarrhoea, add half a teaspoon of salt to a 250ml glass of water or apple juice and make sure you sip it slowly.</p><p>“You could also try sports drinks but not fizzy ones.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>“If you’re worried vomiting isn’t settling after 48 hours or you’re having diarrhoea for more than seven days, seek medical help.”<br>You can also get food poisoning if someone who is sick handles food that you eat.</p><p>Make sure anyone who is unwell stays out of the kitchen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqGcmqSknXxzgZBub2luaGSvrbvAraCnn12oubazxqKqoWWTnb%2Bqv9OmmKxllqS8pXnToqesZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ncsojwpwdc1rxh2kayobt9v7jmupwlce.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Watch Ricky Zoom Season 1 Episode 2: Flat Out Awesome/Ricky's Rescue Coaching Badge</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jessa-duggar-how-does-she-feel-about-jinger-wearing-pants.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Does She Feel About Jinger Wearing Pants?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

Born in Guangzhou, raised in Hong Kong and Shanghai, Pei drew inspiration at an early age from the garden villas at Suzhou, the traditional retreat of the scholar-gentry to which his family belonged. In 1935, he moved to the United States and enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania's architecture school, but he quickly transferred to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was unhappy with the focus at both schools on Beaux-Arts architecture, and spent his free time researching emerging architects, especially Le Corbusier. After graduating, he joined the Harvard Graduate School of Design and became a friend of the Bauhaus architects Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer. In 1948, Pei was recruited by New York City real estate magnate William Zeckendorf, for whom he worked for seven years before establishing an independent design firm in 1955, I. M. Pei & Associates.</p><table class=wikibox readability=11.5><tr><td class=wk_label>Native name</td><td class=wk_value>貝聿銘</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>April 26, 1917, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Republic of China</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Died</td><td class=wk_value>May 16, 2019, Manhattan, New York City, U.S.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=wk_label>Alma mater</td><td class=wk_value>University of Pennsylvania, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (BArch), Harvard University (MArch)</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Occupation</td><td class=wk_value>Architect</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Children</td><td class=wk_value>T'ing Chung Pei (1945–2003), Chien Chung Pei (1947–), Li Chung Pei (1949–), Liane Pei (1960–)</td></tr></table><p>Architect I.

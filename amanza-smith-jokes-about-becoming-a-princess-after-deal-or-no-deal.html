Markle, who married <a href=#><strong>Prince Harry</strong></a> in May 2018, <a href=#>was a suitcase model on the show for two seasons</a> before starring on <a href=#>Suits</a> beginning in 2011.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Amanza-Smith-Was-1-Season-Shy-Being-Princess-After-Deal-No-Deal-001.jpg><p>“She was on a season before me, and I always joke because I’m mixed, like, ‘I was one season shy being a princess,’” she exclusively told Us, while looking back at a throwback 2008 photo <a href=#>she posted on Instagram</a> in April 2018. “I love it. I don’t think I would have fit in the royal palace. I have too many tattoos and yeah [and] I like to drink.”</p><p>While discussing the social media snap, which showed Smith in a pink fitted dress holding case No. 19, the reality star noted she might have also been pregnant at the time with her first child, daughter Noah.</p><p>“That’s before my daughter was born, so it was at least 11 years ago. The first round of Deal or No Deal,” she explained. “I think I was probably pregnant in that picture and didn’t know it because when we went on hiatus — when we wrapped this season — I found out I was pregnant with Noah, like, probably two weeks later. So, she could have been in that she could have been the bun in the oven right there.”</p><p>The TV personality, who shares Noah and son Braker with <a href=#>her ex-husband, <strong>Ralph Brown</strong></a>,&nbsp;also revealed the story behind one of her <a href=#>funniest Instagram videos</a> involving chicken wings and bikini lunges.</p><p>Smith explained that after her friends asked whether she and pal <a href=#><strong>Mary Fitzgerald</strong></a> did Pilates or worked out often to stay in such good shape, the duo found themselves exercising at a pool party together in April 2018.</p><p>“Neither one of us have literally seen the inside of a gym in like 10 years,” the model told Us, noting she “went through the [phase] where I was, like, ‘I feel like I’m getting a mom ass. It used to be here and now, it’s, like, half leg, half ass.’”</p><p>So, while at a pool party at her boss <a href=#><strong>Jason Oppenheim</strong></a>’s house, she said, “I’m just going to lunge everywhere I go,” turning to Fitzgerald, 39, for help. “I was, like, ‘OK, I need some motivation,’” she recalled. “[Mary] was literally holding like a chicken leg and I was lunging towards the food.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>For more on <a href=#>Smith’s sauciest and most memorable</a> Instagram photos, including what happened when <a href=#>the Selling Sunset ladies</a> took <a href=#><strong>Heather Rae Young</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Tarek El Moussa</strong></a>’s boat out before the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown, watch the exclusive Us Weekly video above.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapZGjx6J50qagraBdn7yssdJmmJunpal6o7HCqKSippdirm680aKlnJ2jqHqistOeqWaclZa5brvRZqWoZZSarq17</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./daniel-ganc.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Daniel Ganc net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./frank-shorter.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Life of Legendary Frank Shorter!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

It gets much crazier than it ever got in season one."</p><h2>Will viewers see Eleven in season two of Stranger Things?</h2><p>Eleven was one of the most-loved characters of season one, and her relationship with Mike made everybody swoon.</p><p>But after Eleven sacrificed herself to defeat the demogorgon and save her new pals it’s unclear if viewers see her again – as she’s now stuck in the Upside Down.</p><p>Actress <a href=#>Millie Bobby Brown</a> has admitted she has no idea if her character will be returning to our screens, but co-star&nbsp;David Harbour, who plays chief Hopper, gave fans hope.</p><p>He recently revealed the Eggo waffles he leaves in a box at the end of Season One ARE for Eleven.</p><p>He said: "He (Hopper) may understand that Eleven exists in some form. And so he’s got this box out in the woods where he gives her food."</p><p>Further teasing fans the name Eleven is shouted out in the latest season two trailer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/nintchdbpict0002636892391.jpg><h2>Is Brenner dead in Stranger Things?</h2><p>Dr. Martin Brenner - played by Matthew Modine - was last seen being attacked by the demogorgon in the school, but Matt Duffer has gave a strong hint that it isn't the end of the manipulative scientist.</p><p>He said: "I would say that if we were going to kill Brenner . . . as an audience member watching the show, if that was his death, that would be very unsatisfying to me, when the monster jumps on him and we cut away.</p><p>"He would deserve much more than that as an ending. So yes, there's a possibility of seeing him again."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/nintchdbpict000264843269.jpg><h2><strong>Will Barb return to season two of &nbsp;Stranger Things?</strong></h2><p>Poor mom-jean-wearing, big-glasses-sporting Barb, she didn't have a great time in the first season, having been snatched by the demogorgon in episode two before her death was pretty much confirmed in episode seven.</p><p>However her sticky end has not stopped fans speculating her time is not yet over.</p><p>While creator Matt said he “can’t see [Barb’s return] happening” he insists “she will not be forgotten”.</p><p>He added: “We’ll make sure there’s some justice for Barb. People get very frustrated, understandably, that the town doesn’t seem to be really dealing with Barb.</p><p>“That stuff is all happening. We’re just not spending any screen time on it.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">more on stranger things</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhpaW6Gdn6XaKqtqpGjtKa%2BjK2foqaXqHq0scCspqdlYmLCrHnRnqOemaOaeqWt055kraGdmnqkrdKtZK2qkZ65pr6O</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./stunning-punters-brave-weather-frocks-york-ebor-festival.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Stunning punters brave damp weather and wear glam frocks to York's Ebor Festival as racegoers enjoy</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./katherine-heigl-friends-designed-eras-style-shirt-45th-birthday-8418371.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Katherine Heigl's Friends Designed Eras-Style Shirt for Her 45th Birthday</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

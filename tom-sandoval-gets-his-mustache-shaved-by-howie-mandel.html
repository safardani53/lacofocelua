The Vanderpump Rules star wasn’t satisfied with the outcome, however, and took a razor to his face to remove the remaining hair. “Wow! I feel weird,” Sandoval said of his fresh face.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Prior to the surprising beauty moment, Sandoval got candid about his romance with Leviss, 28, which took place while he was dating <a href=#><strong>Ariana Madix</strong></a>.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Tom-Sandoval-Gets-His-Mustache-Shaved-Live-by-Howie-Mandel-2.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>He explained that prior to the world finding out about the scandal, he and Madix, 37, were experiencing a rough patch and attempting to work through things in therapy. “I already knew that this didn’t feel right … that we both deserved better,” Sandoval said, before admitting that the counseling didn’t work. “As we kept going, I kept putting it out there [that I wanted to break up].” During that same time, the reality star said he was “seeing” Leviss “as often as I could,” claiming that Madix didn’t notice “because that’s just how separate our lives were.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Sandoval later claimed that although they were growing apart, Madix fought for their relationship, which made him feel “so, so bad.” He claimed he ended things with his longtime girlfriend <a href=#>on Valentine’s Day</a> —&nbsp;after initially wanting to call it quits in therapy. “There is never a right time. What is the right time to end a nine-year relationship?” he told Mandel.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Tom-Sandoval-Ariana-Madix-Raquel-Leviss.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>Us Weekly confirmed on March 3, that Sandoval and Madix <a href=#>broke up</a> after the Missouri native cheated with Leviss, who joined the cast of the Bravo series in 2016.</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>During his visit with Mandel, Sandoval also addressed why <a href=#>he’s still living in the house</a> he shared with Madix. “I don’t have a lot of friends I can stay with right now,” Sandoval explained. “I kind of run the house. I handle the gardening, the housekeeping. My assistant comes and cleans and stocks everything. I basically run everything in the house. She’s in the house. This is a big house … We text when we’re coming and going.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>As for his status with Leviss, Sandoval said: “We’re really good friends.

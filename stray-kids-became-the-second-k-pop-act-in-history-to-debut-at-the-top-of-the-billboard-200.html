The trio, which was established via a 2017 survival show and was often chastised for its “noise music,” made massive inroads into the Billboard charts. Stray Kids debuted on the Billboard 200, Artist 100, Top Album Sales, Top Current Album Sales, Bubbling Under Hot 100, and a few more charts in under 24 hours, marking a watershed event in the self-producing group’s career. The STAY fanbase is ecstatic and cheering. MANIAC members, too, contacted followers on Bubble and left heartfelt comments on Instagram, thanking them for their unwavering support. JYP Entertainment even commemorated the occasion with a video.</p><h2>Stray Kids is just the second K-pop artist in history to debut at the top of the Billboard 200.</h2><p>The previous 24 hours have been an emotional roller coaster for STAYs and Stray Kids. In the history of K-pop, the group awoke to become the third-ever group to debut at #1 on the Billboard 200, behind only BTS and SuperM.&nbsp;ODDINARY, the group’s first album in the United States, sold 110,000 copies and debuted at No. 1 on the Top Album Sales list with 103,000 sales.&nbsp;As of March 2022, ODDINARY has the greatest US pure sales week of any album released in 2022.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/stray-kids-1-1.jpg alt="stray kids" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The multi-talented self-producing group also debuted at No. 1 on Artist 100, becoming just the fourth K-pop group to do so. They are also the only fourth-generation group to be listed in the charts, barring SuperM (a blend of SM’s prior group members).&nbsp;The Thunderous boy band even reached the top of the Top Current Album Sales ranking. They also debuted at No. 19 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 with MANIAC and at No. 1 on the World Digital Song Sales list.&nbsp;MANIAC continued its winning run by arriving at No. 21 on the Billboard Global 200 Singles list, while ODDINARY debuted at No. 1 on the World Albums chart.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>.<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">@Stray_Kids</a>‘ ‘Oddinary’ officially debuts at No. 1 on this week’s <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#Billboard200</a>.</p><p>It earns the group its first career No. 1 album and first entry on the chart.</p><p>— billboard charts (@billboardcharts) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">March 28, 2022</a></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/stray-kids-2.jpg alt="Stray Kids " width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>Stray Kids</p><p>The exciting day does not finish there. ODDINARY by Stray Kids premiered at No. 2 on the Billboard Tastemaker Albums list, while MANIAC debuted at No. 15 on the Global Excl. US chart. MANIAC was ranked No. 2 on Twitter’s most current Hot Trending Songs ranking.&nbsp;The eight-member group had a Twitter chat with writer Jeff Benjamin and Billboard executive director Jason Lipshutz on their astounding feat of being just the third K-pop act in history to top the Billboard 200 chart.&nbsp;JYP Entertainment’s recent collaboration with US record company Republic Records seems to have provided Stray Kids with a significant push in the right direction. With the spectacular success of only one mini-album, it remains to be seen what the trio will accomplish on their future global tour with another record, as promised in Step Out 2022.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiqraqRrnqstcOsZJudk5a6pnnToZxmq5WYvK%2BwjKRkqaegYq6kwIyipWagmajBsL7YZquoZZSar7bAjJqrZqyYmnq1u89mpp9lpJ2ybq7IpaObp5GnsW5%2Bj2lm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./anna-shannon-on-dr-phil.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Anna Shannon on Dr. Phil</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./selena-gomez-and-boyfriend-benny-blanco-kiss-photo-8416524.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Selena Gomez and Boyfriend Benny Blanco Share a Kiss in Sweet Photo</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

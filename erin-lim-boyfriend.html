The pieces feature images and phrases related to Christianity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The couple met at church in 2018 and went Instagram official a year later. Erin first posted a tender video with her beau in July of 2019, which she simply captioned, "ðŸ¥°." Joshua actually confirmed their romance months earlier, in March of 2019.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Erin dated 'New Girl' actor Lamorne Morris before meeting Joshua.</h2><p>Prior to beginning her romance with Joshua, Erin was in a long-term relationship with actor Lamorne Morris. He's best known for playing Winston Bishop on the hit Fox sitcom New Girl.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple first sparked relationship rumors in 2016, and they later explicitly confirmed that they were together when they attended the 2017 Emmy Awards together.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Erin later recounted her Emmys experience to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E!

It's unclear when exactly the couple called it quits on their relationship. Neither Erin nor Lamorne have publicly addressed their breakup, and Erin has evidently moved on with Joshua.&nbsp;</p><p>Lamorne has not posted about being in another relationship since his split from Erin, but he could be keeping his private life under wraps these days.&nbsp;</p><p>As for Erin, we are sure she is busy wedding planning!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmr%2BquoyloKZlkqTGp77InqWd</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chris-morgane-stapleton-relationship-timeline.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chris and Morgane Stapleton's Relationship Timeline</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./stranger-things-eddie-vampire-return-season-5-theory.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Eddie May Return As A Vampire In Season 5 Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

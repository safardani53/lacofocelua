FOOTBALL</h2></p><h2>HUGO LLORIS</h2><p>Last year, Hugo Lloris suffered a gruesome arm injury during Tottenham's Premier League drubbing at Brighton that saw him miss months of action.</p><p>After he spilt a mis-hit cross, the French international fell awkwardly on his left arm and dislocated his elbow.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/NINTCHDBPICT000528368597-e1572862222432.jpg><h2>RYAN SHAWCROSS</h2><p><a href=#>Ryan Shawcross suffered a gruesome leg injury</a> during Stoke's pre-season friendly against Leicester last year which could see him out for the season.</p><p>The tough centre half immediately writhed in agony before a stretcher came on and he was given oxygen after sliding in on Marc Albrighton to win a tackle.</p><p>He was taken to hospital immediately for surgery.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/shawcross.jpg><h2><strong>DJIBRIL CISSE</strong></h2><p>One of the worst we've seen.</p><p>The France striker had remarkable powers of recovery, breaking his leg twice and making it back within six months&nbsp;on both occasions.</p><p>The one for Les Bleus looks worse...</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000003447778.jpg><h2><strong>HENRIK LARSSON</strong></h2><p>The Swede picked up a bad one playing for Celtic in a UEFA Cup tie against Lyon in 1999.</p><p>The challenge with Serge Blanc left him with a double leg break and out for the rest of the season.</p><p>But he was back playing eight months later, and it could have been worse for the striker - who went on to join Barcelona.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

too long ago when his horror challenge on Ramsey saw the Welshman's leg nearly split in two.</p><p>Ramsey had nine months out but thankfully came back and kicked on leading to his recent mega money £400k-a-week move to Juventus.</p><p>The Gunners midfielder famously blanked Shawcross after the incident and the notorious hard man even claimed the tackle 'changed his public persona'.</p><img

Man Utd in a £33million deal.</p><p>He was cruelly denied ten months of action after suffering a double leg break in a challenge with PSV's Hector Moreno</p><p>The Mexican defender was in tears when he visited the former Southampton left-back in hospital the following day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict0001882578001.jpg><h2>MARCIN WASILEWSKI</h2><p>Now a Premier League champion with Leicester, there was a time when the big Polish defender might have thought his career was over.</p><p>Axel Witsel came in with a studs-up tackle during a heated Anderlecht vs Standard Liege clash that earned him an eight-game ban and left Wasilewski sidelined for ten months.</p><p>He considered suing and threatened to snub a handshake when they crossed paths again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000280731064.jpg><h2>GARY MABBUTT</h2><p>While the leg breakers will turn your stomach, this facial injury was genuinely scary.</p><p>Former Spurs defender Mabbutt had his face smashed in by a filthy elbow from Wimbledon's John Fashanu.</p><p>It left him with a cheekbone fractured in four places and an eye socket cracked in three.</p><p>Mabbutt needed a metal plate inserted and was out the game for 12 months.</p><img

TRAUTMANN</h2><p>Trautmann - a former German prisoner of war - broke his neck before playing on to help Manchester City beat Birmingham City 3-1 in the 1956 FA Cup final.</p><p>Heroic or foolish?</p><p>You can decide...</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000000488306.jpg><h2>PETR CECH</h2><p>Cech broke his skull diving at the feet of Reading's Stephen Hunt in 2006 when playing for Chelsea.</p><p>He needed three months out after an op and wore head protection for the rest of his career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000003957712.jpg><h2><strong>EDUARDO DA SILVA</strong></h2><p>An unpleasant tackle with an unpleasant ending.</p><p>Birmingham defender Martin Taylor saw red after this horrific lunge on the Gunners forward.</p><p>And Brazilian midfielder Gilberto Silva had to act as translator to medical staff as he spoke Portuguese and English.</p><p>Eduardo needed a year&nbsp;to recover, but managed to continue his career at Arsenal and then Shakhtar Donetsk.</p><img

DYER</h2><p>Just ten days after his West Ham debut, following a £6million move from Newcastle, the England midfielder's career was left in tatters.</p><p>A tackle by Bristol Rovers' Joe Jacobsen left his leg broken in two places.</p><p>Already troubled by injuries, Dyer needed 17 months out and was never the same player again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

midfielder.</p><p>Photo speaks for itself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000003107277.jpg><h2><strong>FEDERICO MATTIELLO</strong></h2><p>If it wasn't for bad luck, the Juventus starlet would have had no luck at all.</p><p>He'd already broken his leg once in his career before a collision with Roma tough-nut Radja Naingollan produced this shocker.</p><p>At just 21, the defender was on loan at Chievo at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

Villa's Belgian forward as one of his favourite strike partners.</p><p>He then netted on his debut against Chelsea in 2000.</p><p>But his career was over two games later after a collision with Ipswich keeper Richard Wright left him fearing his leg would need to be amputated.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

among English football fans.</p><p>But this was a career-ending shocker too.</p><p>The American keeper snapped his tibia and fibula after crashing into New York Red Bulls striker Dane Richards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

She denies this.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In early 2018, in the shadow of the rise of the #MeToo movement, Congress <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>passed new rules</a> forbidding relationships between lawmakers and their staffers as a way to combat sexual harassment and misconduct on Capitol Hill.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hill is one of the first openly bisexual members of Congress and was given a top position on the House Oversight Committee after flipping a district in Republican control for more than 20 years.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Separately, Hill did admit to an “inappropriate” relationship with an aide on her congressional campaign.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Clearly there is an inherent power differential between Congresswoman Hill and a young campaign staffer who worked for her, but there’s nothing unlawful about having a relationship with people who work for you as long as it is consensual,” outside attorney Debra Katz <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told The New York Times</a>. “But clearly this shows bad judgment.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The initial articles about Hill, which began with posts on the conservative website RedState, wove claims about her relationships with both Kelly, the staffer, and the campaign worker together with compromising photos of Hill, alleged text messages between her and her husband and others and descriptions of her personal life.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The sources of this information have been not identified, though Hill maintains that her estranged husband, Kenny Heslep, is responsible.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to RedState, Hill had allegedly been in a three-way relationship with both the campaign worker and Heslep, who filed for divorce from Hill this summer, citing “irreconcilable differences.” They married in 2010.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following RedState reports, The Daily Mail, a British tabloid, published further intimate photos and details about Hill’s relationships.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Monday, Hill again suggested Heslep was behind what she called a “coordinated campaign carried out by the right wing media and Republican opponents.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Enabling and perpetuating my husband’s abuse by providing him a platform is disgusting and unforgivable and they will be held accountable,” she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>separate letter released Sunday</a> about her resignation, Hill said she was “pursuing all … available legal options” over the “illegal” release of “private photos.” Her attorneys <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>reportedly sent a cease-and-desist letter</a> to the Mail demanding the photos be taken down. She said last week that police were also investigating, according to the Times.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Monday, Hill vowed that now she would move into a “new fight” against “revenge porn” and “digital exploitation.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Since the smear campaign began, the Congresswoman has continued to receive threats from both her husband and Republican political operatives, who have said they were far from done releasing private, potentially obscene photographs,” an aide to Hill tells PEOPLE.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hill said in her Monday video statement that she resigned to avoid allowing such attacks to distract from the work of her colleagues. Once she formally leaves office — <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>which Politico reports</a> could be as soon as Nov. 1 — she said she would work to “ensure no one else has to live through what I just experienced.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Former Rep.

California Rep. Duncan Hunter, for example, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>will go on trial next year</a> after being accused of using campaign money <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>to carry on affairs</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4>for other personal expenses</a>. He pleaded not guilty and has not left office.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The spread of Hill’s deeply personal photos highlights changing laws, too: In recent years, more and more governments have taken steps to criminalize the nonconsensual release of sexually explicit material.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Some people call this electronic assault, digital exploitation. Others call it revenge porn,” Hill said in her Monday video. “As the victim of it, I call it one of the worst things that we can do to our sisters and our daughters. … I will not allow my experience to scare off other young women or girls from running for office.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Forty-six states <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>now have revenge porn laws</a>, including California. A first offense, considered a misdemeanor, is punishable with up to six months in jail and a fine up to $1,000, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>according to the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">California Sen. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kamala Harris</a>, who has sponsored a bipartisan bill which would make the publication of revenge porn a federal crime, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>told BuzzFeed News</a> that she while she “respected” Hill’s decision to leave office, she added: “Let’s also speak the truth that men and women are not held to the same standards. I mean — look at who’s in the White House.” (She was referring to multiple allegations of sexual misconduct against President Donald Trump, which he denied.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Harris also told BuzzFeed News that the release of the photographs was “public shaming” that could discourage other women from running for public office.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Heslep did not respond to PEOPLE’s call seeking comment. Kelly told PEOPLE last week he had no comment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Representatives with The Daily Mail and RedState did not respond to messages.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6CkuarAyJyqaKORqbameceio6Vllp60qcDSZqmerpWjtKZ5z6ipp2WeqrGmec%2Bhpq2nXaGyoreMq5ysoZejrrW1zqdm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cheryl-ladd-photos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Photos Of The Charlies Angels Star Then &amp;amp; Now Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./joe-soucheray.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Joe Soucheray net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

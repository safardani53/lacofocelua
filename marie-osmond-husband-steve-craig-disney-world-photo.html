On Friday, Dec. 30, she took to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> to share a photo of herself snuggled up to him as they posed outside the “Pandora – The World of Avatar” section of Disney’s Animal Kingdom. She had a blissful smile on her face as she leaned into her hubby, and he showed her affection with his arm around her shoulders.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Dancing with the Stars alum</a> appeared to debut a hair makeover as well. She seemingly dyed her usual shoulder-length brunette locks to a light blonde. The change appears to be super recent, as she was brunette in a video she posted to her Instagram page just three days ago.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> family trip to the world-famous amusement park</a> came after Marie led <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Disney’s Candlelight Procession</a> between Dec. 24 and Dec. 26, which she mentioned in her caption. “After we finished the #CandlightCelebration at Epcot, I’ve been blessed to spend the week with my family here at Walt Disney World!” she enthusiastically wrote. “I hope you have all had a relaxing and wonderful week!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>In the second photo Marie posted, Steve, a former professional basketball player, could be seen walking through the park with several of their grandkids. Marie has eight grandchildren in total between seven of her kids with Stephen, her first and current husband, and her second husband,<strong> Brian Blosil</strong>. Marie <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>had eight kids</a>, but one tragically died by suicide in 2010.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Marie-Osmond-Steve-Craig-disneyland-shutter-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>As noted above, Marie and Stephen were married, got divorced, and then remarried. They were originally married in 1982 and welcomed one son, <strong>Stephen</strong>, before <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>they parted in 1985</a>. The former Donny & Marie star then went on to have two more biological kids with Brian and adopt five. Marie and Steve reconnected after her 2007 divorce and hit it off. They walked down the aisle once again in 2011 at the Las Vegas Mormon Temple.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Marie has previously opened up about reconnecting with Steve and said she believes God brought them together. “Nothing is an accident. I am a spiritual person. So [I believe] God has his timing,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE </a>in 2019.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“The thing about a second marriage is that you realize things you thought were so important, aren’t,” she added later on in the interview. “I love being with my husband. He is the sweetest man I know. He lives to serve and really listens to people’s needs.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>She also praised him for completely turning around her life. “[Steve] took my life from crazy and hectic and sad and discombobulated,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Closer Weekly</a> in October 2019. “My last marriage [with Brian] was tough, and [Steve] just kind of put all the pieces back together.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ze5JpZqaZop6ybrvSpqannF2dwrSuwKebZqukmsOmecKrmKKfXZm2tLrEsmSwp6KhsW68x6irqGc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sabrina-quesada-break-up-cooper-noriega.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sabrina Quesada and Boyfriend Cooper Noriega Have Split</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bradley-cooper-and-gigi-hadids-relationship-timeline-5214654.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bradley Cooper and Gigi Hadids Relationship Timeline Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

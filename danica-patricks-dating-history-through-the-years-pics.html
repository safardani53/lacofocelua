Instead, she’s taken a live and learn approach to her relationships. “You know, the idea that you’re going to change someone is a pipe dream,” she told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> exclusively in September 2021. “Like, it’s just … someone has to want to change for themselves.”</p><p>While she admitted to Us that “<a href=#>relationships are not easy,</a>” her enlightened outlook on love comes from “knowing herself” better and also understanding <a href=#>what she wants in a partner</a>.</p><p>“It’s not necessarily that they have their work cut out for him but that they’re going to be an extremely high-quality person with a lot of boxes to check,” she told Tamron Hall in March 2021. “It’s not as though there are boxes to check, it’s just that I know what I want now and I’m not willing to compromise [or] bend as much.”</p><p>The <a href=#>“Pretty Intense” podcast host</a> wants a partner who is “someone [who] has done the work and continues to do it,” she told Us, adding, “[It’s about] finding someone that has that kind of quality … and that also fits you in so many ways. That’s the other part, you’ve got to like doing everything together.”</p><p>Looking back at <a href=#>Patrick’s dating history</a>, it’s clear <a href=#>she likes a sporty guy</a> who can keep up with her. No easy task, since the only woman to win an IndyCar Series race doesn’t like to lose. “I think that my competitive nature makes me want to do well, but I don’t think anyone has put any kind of, you know, goal on my shoulders that I need to do,” she said while speaking about training for <a href=#>the 2021 Boston Marathon</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>With all the lessons she’s learned about love, Patrick wouldn’t mind <a href=#>getting married again</a>. “I mean, I love love,” she told Us, joking, “If anyone wants to invite me to a wedding, I’ll go because I love weddings. They’re the best events ever.”</p><p>Keep reading to meet all of Patrick’s past loves:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksaK6yJyYZqiRqb%2Bqr8qsZJ2ZpJ67qHnHoqqtp6KuerW00aisoKBdqbWmediemKurXaW2pL%2BO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./denim-jackets-over-mini-dresses-celebrities-pics-photos-3483485.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Denim Jackets Over Mini Dresses See Celebrities Rocking The Look Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./carmen-electra-puts-bare-butt-on-display-thong-bodysuit.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Carmen Electra, 51, puts her bare butt on display in a thong bodysuit and thigh-high boots as she te</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

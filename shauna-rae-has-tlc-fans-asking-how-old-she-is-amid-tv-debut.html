Now, fans are wondering how old she actually is amid her TV debut.</strong></p><p>From dating to drinking, she’s just like any other person her age. We see all of her ups and downs on I Am Shaunae Rae, such as her dream of going to college and being told there is a possibility she may not be able to have children.</p><p>Due to her size, Shauna is often mistaken for being a young child. Reality Titbit is clearing up any speculation and found out her real age and height.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure>BridTV66211000-lb Sisters | Season 3 Trailer | TLC900478900478center22403<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-shauna-rae-s-real-age>Shauna Rae’s real age</h2><p>Born in 1999, Shauna Rae is currently 22 years old at the time of writing. She stopped growing when she was 16 years old, and continues to face others thinking she is under the age of 12.</p><p>As a result of being trapped in an eight-year-old’s body, she often gets turned away by bartenders, and has problems getting tattoos or a gym membership.</p><p>The TLC show highlights how much she wants to be treated like an adult, and said that it was the “lowest time of her life” when she first learned of her stunted growth, as reported by <a href=#>People</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#Iamshaunarae</a> I just have to say I LOVE this young woman!!!!

Her height is considered to be the average size of an eight-year-old.</p><p>She revealed to People that she is often not treated “like a normal human” because of her appearance. Shauna first realized she wasn’t growing at the same rate as her peers around kindergarten time.</p><p>However, it was not until junior high that it began affecting her mental health. Shauna said:</p><p>It was a very difficult time. It probably was the lowest time of my life, because I always imagined that I would be tall. And getting that news, it just kind of was like a hammer crashing into glass.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I can actually relate to Shauna A LOTTTT.

Despite going into remission, the treatment left her pituitary gland dormant.</p><p>She was just six months old at the time of her diagnosis. If the pituitary gland doesn’t function properly, it can affect vital parts like your brain, skin, energy, mood, reproductive organs, vision and growth.</p><p>Shauna required surgery and went through three and a half years of chemotherapy, after being told she had Grade 4 malignant glioma, a cancerous brain tumor. Now, her mom worries that the cancer could return.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by 🎗ЅℋᎯUℕᎯ🐘 (@thereal_shaunarae99)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<p class=has-text-align-center>WATCH I AM SHAUNA RAE ON TLC EVERY TUESDAY AT 9 PM</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>INSTAGRAM</a> AND <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>FACEBOOK</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfrLWiwNJmpqdno52utrrAZqmanV2drrR506WaZp6Ro8BurdKkoKefXZ28uHnOpZtmq5iaeqq%2FjJqkopxdqcNusMSbrK0%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./leonie-hanne.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Leonie Hanne</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./woman-receives-lifetime-ban-carnival-cruises-after-bringing-cbd-gummies-8404491.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Woman Receives Ban from Carnival Cruises After Bringing CBD Gummies</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

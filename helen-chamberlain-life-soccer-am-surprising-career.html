including her surprising new career.</p><h2>Early fame</h2><p>Helen was destined to be an entertainer - she thrilled crowds at Pontins holiday club working as a Bluecoat before getting her big break.</p><p>It was while appearing as an announcer at Chessington World of Adventures that she was discovered by a producer at Nickelodeon - and launched her presenting career in 1994.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="MORE SHOWBIZ FEATURES ">MORE SHOWBIZ FEATURES</h2><p>The following year her big break came when she was asked to present on Soccer AM.</p><p>She hosted alongside <a href=#>Tim Lovejoy</a> and instantly became a fan favourite.</p><p>In May 2004 she told a magazine she landed the gig completely by chance, admitting: "My whole career has been an accident."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/g8jj7k-soccer-presenter-helen-chamberlain-805052938.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/36e3c4d8-153c-47dd-988f-70bf783a9b08.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/b1517fd9-436f-4661-95ee-0c93536b7616.jpg><p>The 90-minute comedy talk show provided a rundown of the week's football events and featured skits and challenges for guests and viewers.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>Around that period, Helen was given the opportunity to guest host Channel 4's <a href=#>The Big Breakfast</a> with Johnny Vaughan, and its successor, RI:SE.</p><p>In-demand Helen also landed a gig as a presenter on Sky's dedicated poker channel, and fronted Channel 5's late-night sports show, Live and Dangerous.</p><p>Her popularity led to an appearance in Penthouse magazine, where she shot a cheeky nude photoshoot with her hands barely covering her modesty.</p><p>In the accompanying interview she spoke about her wild days before joining Soccer AM, admitting: "I did drink a bit in those days and you just stayed up all night every night getting p****d with the cabaret turns."</p><p>Helen certainly wasn't shy - in 2004 she stripped off at Trafalgar Square to reveal her patriotic underwear to cheer on England in the Euros.</p><p>She was also famed for her cheeky red carpet antics - once lowering her skirt to show off a T.U.F.C tattoo on her hip - a tribute to her beloved Torquay United football team.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2gxa9be-soccer-presenter-helen-chamberlain-805053098.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/g5100d-loaded-chamberlain-805053030.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2d6ykf4-helen-chamberlain-russ-williams-804878087-1.jpg><h2>Sports star</h2><p>From a young age, Helen was a keen <a href=#>darts</a> player and when she got older, competed at pub league level.</p><p>She claims to have beaten professional darts player Eric Bristow during a game of darts cricket.</p><p>In 2012 Helen was the Woking & District ladies' darts singles champion - and she reportedly dated one of the sport's biggest stars, James Wade.</p><p>They were seen as a power couple in the darts world - once dubbed the '<a href=#>Posh and Becks</a>' of the sport.</p><p>Talking about their alleged romance, James coyly said at the time: "Some of the things I've read are not quite true, but we all have good friends, whether they are male or female.</p><p>"Helen loves darts - perhaps that's why we get on so well - but people are putting two and two together and making seven.

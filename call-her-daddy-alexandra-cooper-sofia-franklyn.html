Not labor," Alex told viewers.</p><p>"I think this is where Barstool and I are pretty frustrated. That's all it is. Everyone realized she was never gonna be happy.</p><p>"Sofia did not take the deal and when it got held up and there were no more points coming from her side, we had to move forward without her.</p><p>"There were more and more points and then eventually, she stopped sending points, and then she never sent her points. She said she wanted it. She never signed it."</p><p>Meanwhile, Sofia commented via Instagram: "I found out that Alex had gone behind my back and done something. And I found out it wasn’t the first time. And that’s why we’re here. I trusted Alex. I feel betrayed.</p><p>"This is where the story gets extremely f**ked up. There’s been a lot of crazy s**t being thrown around, and some of it is true, and some of it is false.</p><p>"I am willing to do Call Her Daddy. I really am.

So every step of the way, I was looking at myself in the mirror, making faces to try to see what this character would eventually be,” he added.</p><p>The movie is hitting theaters on Friday, September 8, and it’s an adaptation of&nbsp;<a href=#><b>Stephen King</b></a>’s 1986 novel of the same name and follows the TV miniseries that aired in 1990 starring <b>Tim Curry</b> as Pennywise. Skarsgard felt the pressure of filling Curry’s shoes but he told <i>Us</i> he hopes to bring something unique to the role.<b></b></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“Tim Curry’s performance was amazing. It was such a good interpretation of <a href=#>Stephen King</a>’s character in the book,” he said. “We were making a new film, a new adaptation of the book. Of course, I wanted to bring something different and unique to it. Otherwise, I don’t see the point in remaking something. I hope that people can consider both performances separately and appreciate them for what they are.”</p><p>Once he landed the role, the actor, 27, admitted that he felt a bit of self-doubt, and didn’t want to disappoint the film’s director <b>Andrés Muschietti</b> and producer <b>Barbara Muschietti</b>.</p><p>“I think the first step was there were people who had to be convinced that I could do the job. There was a long process of getting cast. Once I got the role, I was like, ‘I got the role!’ Then I was like, ‘Oh my God, I got the role. How am I going to do this? How am I going to live up these expectations?’” he confessed. “Andy and Barbara, the director and producer, trusted in me, and I really didn’t want to let them down. It was a mixed feeling, but ultimately, of course, I loved the whole thing.”</p><p>Skarsgard believes there’s still a need for horror films for people to escape the reality of what is happening in the world at the moment.</p><p>“I think the world seems to be a very scary place now. More so than ever. Watching a scary movie, you get scared, but it’s safe. There is no real Pennywise, but there are a lot of real scary things going on in the world,” he said. “I don’t know if people are into horror films now more than ever. But I feel that’s what horror films do. You go to see something that’s pretend, and you get scared but it’s not real life. It’s a good feeling.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><i>It</i> hits theaters this Friday, September 8.</p><p>For the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, <a href=#>subscribe to</a> Us Weekly’s YouTube Page.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmipJxiwKyt0ayemqqUYsGiuMqsZJqan6rBbrTIrGSpnZ6jxri10p5kppmbmsKxecWoqWahpGK6sMLInmSwbWBmg3J8jg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./foe-movie-5154508.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cast, Release Date &amp;amp; More About Saoirse Ronans Film Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./andrea-torres-boyfriend-list.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Andrea Torre Dating Andrea Torre's Boyfriend &amp;amp; Exes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

Find out everything you need to know about Yo Gotti here.</p><h2>1. Yo Gotti is a rapper</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Yo Gotti has long been established as a musician for over two decades. He’s dropped 11 albums since he started making music, plus a wide range of mixtapes and collaborations with other major artists in the genre. He dropped his major label debut Live from the Kitchen in January 2012. Yo Gotti dropped his most recent album CM10: Free Game&nbsp;in February 2022 and the compilation&nbsp;Gangsta Art&nbsp;with&nbsp;<strong>Moneybagg Yo,&nbsp;</strong>and other artists in July 2022. He’s worked with tons of huge names throughout his career, appearing on collaborations with the likes of&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Nicki Minaj,</a> <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Gucci Mane</a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Megan Thee Stallion</a>,&nbsp;</strong>and many more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Yo-Gotti-Angela-Simmons-New-Boyfriend-shutter-embed-2.jpg><h2>2. He started his music career as a teen</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Born in Memphis, Tennessee in May 1981, Yo Gotti was inspired to pursue a career in music from a very young age. Before changing his name to Yo Gotti, he performed under the similar pseudonym&nbsp;<strong>Lil Yo,&nbsp;</strong>before changing his name for his 2000 record&nbsp;From Da Dope Game 2 Da Rap Game.&nbsp;He dropped his debut album&nbsp;Youngsta’s On A Come-Up&nbsp;in 1996, when he was just 15, but unfortunately, his early work is seemingly absent from streaming services, like Spotify and Apple Music.</p><h2>3. He founded a record label</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>After over a decade in the game, Yo Gotti established his own label Collective Music Group in 2012 to give new artists a platform to share their music. CMG, which once stood for Cocaine Muzik Group, put out the&nbsp;Gangsta Art&nbsp;compilation in July 2022, and the label boasts tons of young talent, including&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>GloRilla</a>,&nbsp;</strong>Moneybagg Yo, and plenty of other rising stars, and they regularly share info about the rising talent on its <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> page.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Yo Gotti spoke about what it meant to be a mentor to Moneybagg in particular in an <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>exclusive interview</a> with <strong>HollywoodLife </strong>in January 2020. “I believe in strength in numbers. I believe in learning information [and] passing it down. Any information I have. I give it to him. I give it to my other artists. If I help them accomplish in two or three years what it took me eight to ten years to accomplish, why not?” he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Yo-Gotti-Angela-Simmons-New-Boyfriend-shutter-embed-3.jpg><h2>4. He’s been nominated for 3 B.E.T. Awards</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>With over 20 years of making music, Yo Gotti started receiving more critical acclaim in the more recent parts of his career. He received some of his earliest award nominations in 2014, when he received his first B.E.T. Hip Hop award nomination for Best Album for his record&nbsp;I Am.&nbsp;He received two more nominations in 2017 for his song “Rake It Up” with Nicki Minaj for Best Collab, Duo or Group and for&nbsp;Gotti Made It&nbsp;for Best&nbsp; Mixtape. That same year, he was also nominated for the Rhythm and Bars Award at the Soul Train Awards for “Rake It Up.”</p><h2>5. He was married twice</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Aside from going public with Angela, Yo Gotti&nbsp; has mostly kept his personal life out of the spotlight, but he has been married twice before he started dating Angela. He also reportedly has six children from previous relationships, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Sun</a>. He was first married to <strong>Lakeisha Mims&nbsp;</strong>and has two kids. He also has three kids with his second wife <strong>Jammie Moses.&nbsp;</strong>Despite the two marriages, not much is known about either relationship.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2LGsHnGqKutoV2nrrG8xKtkbXFpbX13hY4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-catch-season-1-episode-1-has-shonda-rhimes-done-it-again.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Has Shonda Rhimes Done It Again?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-julia-telles-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Julia Telles Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

She was the judges’ first alternate after <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Beckett McDowell</strong></a> dropped out of the top 26. She stunned the judges with her rendition of “Wrecking Ball,” and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Katy Perry</strong></a> admitted that she was wrong to send Paige home. “You belong here,” Katy told Paige.</p><h2>2. Paige was eliminated in season 21’s Final Judgment.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>The judges had originally eliminated Paige Anne from the competition as they were making their decisions about the top 26.

Wow, what are you doing here?”</p><p class=p1>Former cast members Rudolph, 51, and Wiig, 50, <a href=#>dressed in matching sparkly dresses</a>, quipped that they “were just walking by” the set during the broadcast.</p><p class=p1>“It’s so good to see you and it’s so great to be back. [We have] so many memories,” Wiig chimed in. “You know, I looked myself up on Wikipedia the other day, as I do every day, and it said I was in over 38,000 sketches here.”</p><p class=p1>McKinnon quickly pointed out that Wikipedia “isn’t the most reliable” for certain facts, but Wiig asserted that it was correct since her entry noted that she has 12 Grammy wins and is dating NFL star <strong>Travis Kelce</strong>. (Wiig was seemingly referencing <strong>Taylor Swift</strong>, whom she previously spoofed on <i>SNL</i>. Kelce, 34, has been dating Swift, also 34, since this summer, several months before they <a href=#>made cameos on the <i>SNL</i><b><i> </i></b>season 49 premiere</a> in October.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Kate-McKinnon-Runs-into-Old-Friends-Kristen-Wiig-and-Maya-Rudolph-During-SNL-Hosting-Debut-01.jpg><p class=p1>Later in the episode, McKinnon enlisted Wiig and Rudolph for <a href=#>several musical sketches</a>. The trio (and current cast member <strong>Bowen Yang</strong>) portrayed the members of ABBA and sang rejected holiday songs. In a second skit, McKinnon, Wiig and Rudolph crooned about working on a tampon farm alongside actress <strong>Paula Pell</strong>.</p><p>McKinnon joined the SNL cast in 2012 and went on to be nominated for 10 Emmy Awards for the show, winning Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series in 2016 and 2017. She departed in May 2022 at the conclusion of season 47. Several other longtime cast members — including <a href=#><strong>Pete Davidson</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Aidy Bryant</strong></a>, <strong>Alex Moffat</strong>, <strong>Kyle Mooney</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Chris Redd</strong></a> and <strong>Melissa Villaseñor</strong> — <a href=#>left the series at the same time</a>, leading to a creative reset.</p><p>In <a href=#>her farewell sketch</a>, McKinnon portrayed one of her recurring characters, alien abductee Colleen Rafferty, as she said goodbye to the show. “Well, Earth, I love you, thanks for letting me stay awhile,” she said in the cold open. “Live from New York, it’s Saturday night!”</p><p>McKinnon later got candid about why she decided to leave SNL. “I thought about it for a very long time and it was very, very hard,” she explained on Live With Kelly and Ryan in July 2022. “All I ever wanted to do in my whole life was be on Saturday Night Live. And so, I did, I loved it, I had the best decade and then I was just, like, <a href=#>my body was tired</a>, and I felt like it was time.”</p><p class=p1>While <a href=#>the <i>Barbie </i>star</a> wasn’t sure at the time if she’d keep watching <i>SNL</i>, she was eager to return as host on Saturday. It was her first time emceeing the variety show.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Saturday’s episode also featured musical performances by <span class=s1><strong>Billie Eilish</strong>.</span> The 21-year-old singer even performed “What I Was Made For?” from the <i>Barbie </i>soundtrack after an introduction by McKinnon (who <a href=#>played Weird Barbie</a>) and director <strong>Greta Gerwig</strong>.</p><p>Saturday Night Live airs on NBC Saturdays at 11:30 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqnpF2nsqStz2aimqyVYrqkt8inpaimXaeytrrIrZysZaeewal5yqugrKyVo3q4tcigZJqmlGK6osXAZqmunJ%2Bhval7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./justin-deas.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Justin Deas net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-sandy-mahl-garth-brooks-ex-wife-3812377.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Sandy Mahl? 5 Things To Know About Garth Brooks Ex-Wife Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

I love that, ‘Will he get married?’ I don’t talk about it because I don’t think about it,” George wrote in an essay for Esquire in 2011.</p><p>The actor was previously married to <strong>Talia Balsam</strong>. The couple got married in 1989 and divorced three years later.</p><p>George continued to have high-profile relationships with stars, including <strong>Céline Balitran</strong>, <strong>Lisa Snowdon</strong>, <strong>Krista Allen</strong>, <strong>Sarah Larson</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Elisabetta Canalis</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Stacy Keibler</strong></a>. Then <a href=#>everything changed</a> after <a href=#>a mutual friend introduced him</a> to Amal in 2013.</p><p>“I was like, ‘I’m never getting married. I’m not gonna have kids,’” he told GQ in November 2020. “‘I’m gonna work, I’ve got great friends, my life is full, I’m doing well.’ And I didn’t know how un-full it was until I met Amal.”</p><p>The couple got <a href=#>engaged less than a year later</a> and got married in Italy in September 2014. George and Amal <a href=#>welcomed twins Alexander and Ella</a> in June 2017.</p><p>“He doubted for so long that he’d get to meet that soulmate he always dreamed of … but when Amal came along, everything changed,” a source exclusively told Us Weekly about the pair in April 2021. “It’s no exaggeration to say she swept him off his feet.”</p><p>The insider noted that George “considers Amal extraordinary” and that the <a href=#>Tomorrowland</a> star “tells anyone who’ll listen how he’s the one who hit the jackpot here, not her.”</p><p>The Oscar winner and the human rights lawyer continue to put “<a href=#>constant effort</a>” into their relationship. “Like any marriage, they’ve had their challenges and needed to adapt to certain situations and challenges,” the source shared. “It’s taken compromise, establishing boundaries and a lot of patience to keep the relationship on track but they’ve done just that.”</p><p>The two continued to remain strong through the COVID-19 pandemic, opting to <a href=#>spend quarantine stateside</a> rather than at their family’s home in Lake Como, Italy. “[Being in Los Angeles] gave them the chance to hit the refresh button, spend time together as a family unit and play family without interruption,” the insider added. “George and Amal are very solid right now.”</p><p>The happy couple showed off their strong bond at the <a href=#>Kennedy Center Honors</a> in December 2022, at which the Fantastic Mr. Fox actor was honored for his work in the entertainment industry.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’m proud of him all the time, but it is really fun to have a weekend like this, celebrating him with the likes of the President and Secretary of State, and his parents,” Amal told <a href=#>Extra</a> at the time. “Hopefully one day we can show our kids some of the things that have been said about him over the course of the weekend.”</p><p>Scroll down to relive all the From Dusk till Dawn star’s romances over the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNktKa70aCcZpucpLyvsdisZKChoqHAbn6PaXBraWFk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./m4-closed-motorway-both-directions.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>M4 closed: Motorway closed in both directions after pedestrian rushed to hospital in horror two-car</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hunter-tylo.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Hunter Tylo net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

"Last year's graduation trip for our oldest son and niece was delayed long enough to become a graduation trip for the family newborns as well!"

"My dad has a cool closet," Michael said in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>PEOPLE's 2022 Sexiest Man Alive issue</a>, in a portfolio of famous sons.

My dad, my brother, and I will be wearing the same black pants and gray shirt and I'm like, I try to look a little different than that.

They're everywhere and are seemingly trying to one-up humans.</p><p>While most of the artificial intelligence technology that has been created for our use is virtual, like a chatbot, there is AI technology being created that doesn't just think like humans, but also acts and looks like humans.</p><p>Take <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mika</a> for example. Mika is a humanoid robot with a job! She was created by Hanson Robotics and the global rum company <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dictador</a>, where she currently serves as CEO.</p><p>It's jarring how much Mika looks and thinks like an actual woman. But at the same time, it's still very obvious that she's a robot. That said, as an actual human being, it makes me feel some type of way. This feeling of unease when seeing a machine try to mimic a human is called the uncanny valley effect, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Verywell Mind</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>However, the uncanny valley effect isn't limited to humanoid robots. It can also be experienced when playing video games with human characters. Or how one feels when they spot a mannequin in a store or human-like characters in an animated movie. For example, before <a href=#>Shrek </a>was released, children actually experienced the uncanny valley effect during test screenings of the movie, claiming that the original Fiona was too human-like.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Not only was the OG Fiona making kids feel frightened, but some kids were crying when she appeared on the screen. Fortunately, she was redesigned before the movie hit the big screen.</p><p>That said, TikTok creators, particularly on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">#makeuptok</a> are very much in their uncanny valley effect era — and we can't blame them. Since robots are trying to mimic humans, why don't we try to mimic them? That's the basis of the uncanny valley makeup trend, which we discuss below.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is the uncanny makeup trend on TikTok?</h2><p>In October 2023, TikTok users started posting videos of themselves in "uncanny valley makeup" for Halloween. The trend got a little traction. Surprisingly though, users were still fascinated by the idea of doing their makeup so elaborately that they looked like artificial humans after Halloween passed.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In November 2023, videos of creators showing off their uncanny valley makeup looks created with the creepy-sounding audio <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brutus (Instrumental)</a><strong> </strong>exploded onto the platform and the uncanny valley makeup trend was born. Some users even shared reaction videos of them surprising their loved ones with wildly unconventional makeup.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>To create an uncanny valley makeup look, most users piled on the foundation, applying it even over their lips in order to make their whole face look pale and fake. For their eyes, many users applied eyeliner to the middle of their lower lid, making sure not to connect the line to the rest of their eye as that would look too human.</p><p>One user even appeared to put something black, perhaps the peel of an olive, in her eyes to make her eyes look fake.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Ultimately, the uncanny valley makeup trend on TikTok is a reflection of our complicated and growing relationship with new technology. It is unsettling, but will likely continue to be a thing as technology continues to advance. The trend is also just a fun way to laugh off our growing anxiety about the future of technology.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqrukrc2nsGaukaG5psWMppiknaWlerW%2BxKebZqyZoMGwtw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bhqczpyd7i4cfcs1zcmkan65qt-9p6uc.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Watch Henry Danger Season 1 Episode 4: Tears Of The Jolly Beetle</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kim-kardashian-gets-73000-cartier-bracelet-from-kanye-west-for-valentines-day-2013152.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kim Kardashian Gets $73,000 Cartier Bracelet From Kanye West for Valentine's Day</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

The reality television series combines two crucial elements: a young, attractive cast and Siesta Key-sized drama. As a result, fans have been faithfully watching the show and giving their opinions on the relationship drama as it unfolds. One cast member in particular is a hot — none other than <a href=#>Alex Kompothecras.</a></p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Love him or hate him, Alex was very strategic in bringing the drama on Siesta Key. Throughout Alex's three seasons of the show, fans watched as he juggled multiple women unapologetically. So, it’s no secret that Alex’s playboy image didn’t bode well with many fans, but his exit from the show was an exception. So, what exactly happened to Alex on Siesta Key?

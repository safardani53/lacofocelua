The New York Times <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> that the lawsuit also came after Fox accusing Tantaros of&nbsp;breaching&nbsp;her employment contract by writing a book without receiving network approval. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Politico.com</a> reported that Andrea Tantaros primarily accused Roger of sexual harassment and inappropriate comments and blamed the channel's toxic environment with&nbsp;a culture of “misogyny” and “intimidation” allowed for Tantaros to be sexually harassed. She <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">complained</a> that Ailes also arranged for her to be&nbsp;illegally surveilled and that the network’s executives created fake social media accounts, known as “sock puppets,” to defame&nbsp;her online. In the suit, Tantaros claimed that Fox News is less Smallville and more Playboy.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Fox News masquerades as a defender of traditional family values, but behind the scenes, it operates like a sex-fueled, Playboy Mansion-like cult, steeped in intimidation, indecency and misogyny.</p><p>Earlier that year, in July,&nbsp;former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson made the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">allegations</a> of sexual harassment against the cable news public, and months later, Tantaros followed suit. In Tantaros's&nbsp;lawsuit,&nbsp;filed in New York State Supreme Court, she alleged that&nbsp;she was forced to "twirl in front of Ailes" and was reportedly threatened by other show executives when she tried to complain. Following the lawsuit,&nbsp;Mr. Ailes resigned but denied all allegations against him.</p><p>She also claimed that she was fired from her weekday show “The Five” in retaliation for&nbsp;speaking up.&nbsp;She also accused Bill O’Reilly and John Roberts of sexual misconduct but didn’t file any lawsuits&nbsp;against them.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>Later in May of 2018, a&nbsp;federal judge <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dismissed</a> the lawsuit, writing that Tantaros's allegations&nbsp;were “based primarily on speculation and conjecture.” The Judge, George B. Daniels of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, also deducted&nbsp;that reason for the dismissal was that Andrea Tantaros failed to make out the basic elements of her claims adequately.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnkaOxs7HAZquapqSWv7C%2FjKGsrJqRo7FuucCrqaKdlGO1tbnL</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./badlinu-youtube-star-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Badlinu (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-troy-baker-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Troy Baker Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

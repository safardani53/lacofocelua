This is exactly how I imagined the house.’”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>O'Hare International Airport</h3><p>The airport where the entire McCallister <a href=#>family</a> rushed through to make it to their flight to <a href=#>Paris</a> was, of course, no other than Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.</p><p>However, according to the Chicago Tribune, the airport is at least a 45-minute trip from Winnetka, which meant that the family should have missed their plane.</p><p>Interestingly, O'Hare was also the backdrop used for what was supposed to be Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport in the film.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Hubbard Woods Pharmacy</h3><p>Remember the pharmacy where Kevin inadvertently shoplifted a toothbrush that may or may not have been approved by the American Dental Association?</p><p>It was shot at Hubbard Woods Pharmacy, which no longer exists today.</p><p>Chicago Tribune notes that it was replaced by a <a href=#>Panera Bread</a> branch, and in 2019, it was turned into Graeter’s Ice Cream shop.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Hubbard Woods Park</h3><p>Meanwhile, the park where Kevin was chased by a policeman still exists.</p><p>It's located at 939 Old Green Bay Road, Winnetka.</p><p>According to Chris Columbus, the film crew had to create a skating rink in the park to shoot the famous chase scene.</p><p>“We built a portable rink just for the scene and also rented a Zamboni to keep the ice in shape,” he recalled.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/joe-pesci-macaulay-culkin-daniel-865381126.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who plays the pizza guy in Home Alone?</h2><p>The pizza delivery guy in Home Alone was <a href=#>played by actor Danny Warhol</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>He was credited in the film as Dan Charles Zukoski.</p><p>Warhol only appeared in the first film in the franchise, but he has credits in over 60 movies and shows, including Cheaper by the Dozen, Holy Hollywood, Stuck on You, My So-Called Life, and <a href=#>Saved by the Bell</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxaG2Ac4SUaKOirKShsm66xKumZqiZr8eiedGeqq2Zpaeur8CMq5yapF2dvK6xjJqjqKaVZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./maria-jose-alvarado-miss-honduras-2014-found-dead-alongside-sist.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Maria Jose Alvarado, Miss Honduras 2014, Found Dead Alongside Sister</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-are-instagram-stories-bigger.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Are Instagram Stories Bigger?

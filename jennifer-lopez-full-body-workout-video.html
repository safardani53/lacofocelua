Some of the exercises that J.Lo did in the clip, included weight training, some bicep curls, and some intense ab workouts. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The singer stunned</a> in her workout clothes, which consisted of a matching black sports bra and leggings. The new song clearly served as some inspiration to push herself in the workout “On my way to a better me,” she wrote in the caption.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Other than keeping on top of her fitness, Jennifer has been open with her fans about what she wants to do throughout 2022.

She spoke about wanting to be the best version of herself that she can. “To be the best mother I can be, the best partner I can be, the best friend I can be, the best daughter, sister, boss – person – that I can be,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/JLo-Full-Body-Workout-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>J.Lo is clearly taking the goal of being her best self super seriously. She’s also shown her commitment and that she’s being the “best partner” she can to her boyfriend&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ben Affleck</a>.&nbsp;</strong>She <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>paid compliments</a> to Ben for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>his performance in the new movie</a>&nbsp;The Tender Bar, while opening a swag box for the film. “There’s a great scene in a bowling alley with Ben and the little boy [<strong>Daniel Ranieri</strong>]. Ben plays his uncle [and] they’re both amazing in the movie. If you haven’t seen it, you should,” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ye5FpZqOdnqO2p7HRZqOoqJWveqfBy6Vkm6eUrnq4u9Gkpq6sXau2pbHOaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sister-wives-star-labels-meri-and-kody-browns-marriage-as-emotionally-abusive.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sister Wives Star Labels Meri and Kody Browns Marriage as &amp;quot;Abusive&amp;quot;</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ariel-winter-huge-boobs-to-attend-ucla-in-the-fall.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ariel Winter, Huge Boobs to Attend UCLA in the Fall</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

This <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>underwear is often seamless</a>, high-waisted, and specifically designed to avoid irritating potential C-section scars, help with absorption for postpartum periods, and help offer compression for extra support as your body starts to adjust back post-baby.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To get more insight about what to look for when shopping for postpartum underwear, we interviewed experts like Dr. Sara B.

"If the birth was via cesarean, then ideally the underwear will not have a band around the scar. It is normal to have postpartum bleeding for weeks following delivery so underwear that can support a heavy pad is ideal, too.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you are hoping to find a supportive option to help with your postpartum bleeding or simply looking for a comfortable undergarment while your body heals, these are the best postpartum underwear options on the market.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-always-discreet-incontinence--postpartum-underwear></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Always Discreet Incontinence Underwear</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Always Discreet Incontinence &amp;amp; Postpartum Underwear" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/ZmVIpjnRkvR1RTwnRZgO_BaCxk8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/always-discreet-incontinence--postpartum-underwear-07033054552f40d881504fe035898964.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This affordable option is easy to use and very absorbent — after all, the brand is known for its pads.

Depending on the amount, this underwear is a great option for postpartum menstrual flow. (According to the brand, they should be able to absorb up to four regular tampons worth of liquid.)

These are pretty much exactly like the ones you will receive when you are in the hospital. The only difference is that you can wash these a few times (according to the brand, they should last up to 5 uses), adding to their cost effectiveness. Thanks to the mesh material, they're a very <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>breathable pair of underwear</a> that's also great for holding a maxi pad.

This style you choose really depends on your preference, but you should always opt for one that gives you more coverage. Stick to styles that are not only breathable but also absorbent, especially during your postpartum period.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Compression</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A lot of times, new moms are told to look for postpartum underwear that has compression, especially if they’ve gone through a C-section. “Compression is a bit controversial,” Dr. Twogood says. “Some people swear by it and it makes them feel stronger and steadier faster. Some people hate the way it makes them feel and cannot tolerate the constriction. It does not seem to change longer-term outcomes — it won't make your belly shrink or prevent the abdominal muscle separation called diastasis all by itself. I tell my patients if it helps with pain and discomfort then use it. If it makes it worse, then don't.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Absorbancy</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In terms of what you should be looking for when it comes to absorbency, Dr. Twogood explains that postpartum bleeding can change week by week. “In general, people have less bleeding after a cesarean compared to a vaginal birth," she says. "Most people have heavy periods like bleeding the week or so that gradually lighten over time. By four to six weeks postpartum, it is common to have very light spotting or bleeding”.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-9ef785d0-b6c3-4acb-9aad-9f4b49c793dc></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=48.958904109589><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.97435897435897><p><span class=accordion__title>How should you wash postpartum underwear?</span></p><p>Some postpartum underwear are single use, so make sure you choose which option you prefer first. Follow the manufacturer’s directions when it comes to washing or hand-washing reusable options to help them last a lot longer.</p><p>A few key things to keep in mind for reusable options are that you should avoid bleach, fabric softener, ironing, and high temperatures with these types of underwear. Try to pre-soak the items to help get rid of blood before washing them. If the underwear itself is machine-washable, we recommend putting them into a <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">mesh intimates bag</a> to help keep them safe from other items in the laundry; we also recommend air drying when possible.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>When can you start wearing normal underwear after birth?</span></p><p>Many people opt to wear postpartum underwear for the first four to six weeks after giving birth since these types of underwear help absorb more liquids. “Timing of this depends on many factors [like] type of birth (vaginal or cesarean) — if vaginal birth, how much recovery the vulva and vagina require, and amount of bleeding,” says Dr. Twogood. “There is no ‘right timing.' It's common for postpartum people to use the typical postpartum mesh underwear for a week or two before transitioning to wearing pads with underwear - most people need more time before transitioning back to thong underwear, though.”</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.95495495495495><p><span class=accordion__title>What size of postpartum underwear do I need?</span></p><p>Whether you're looking for traditional or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>plus-sized underwear</a>, you may have to experiment with a few different sizes because you won’t be the same size as your maternity clothes after you give birth. Women often see a sizing reduction in their stomachs during their postpartum period. Typically, the uterus is expected to go back to its pre-pregnancy state around six months after you give birth.</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-take-our-word-for-it></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Take Our Word For It</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Nikita Charuza</a> is a freelance beauty and fashion editor (and new mom!) with almost a decade of digital media experience.

The Scottish DJ opened up about the situation in a new interview with <a href=#><i>British GQ</i></a>.</p><p>“It was completely the wrong instinct,” Harris, 33, said. “I was protecting what I see as my one talent in the world being belittled. It felt like things were piling on top of me and that was when I snapped.”</p><p>As Swifties will recall, Harris accused Swift, 27, <a href=# rel=noopener>of making him “look bad”</a> after it was revealed that she helped to write his hit “This Is What You Came For.” He initially called her an “amazing lyric writer,” <a href=# rel=noopener>but became defensive in later tweets.</a></p><p>“Hurtful to me at this point that her and her team would go so far out of their way to try and make ME look bad at this stage though,” he wrote at the time. “I figure if you’re happy in your new relationship you should focus on that instead of trying to tear your ex bf down for something to do,” he wrote in a follow-up tweet that was liked almost 3,000 times within half an hour. “I know you’re off tour and you need someone new to try and bury like Katy [Perry] ETC but I’m not that guy, sorry. I won’t allow it.”</p><p>Swift, who has had an ongoing feud with Perry, was dating Tom Hiddleston at the time of the incident. Harris and Perry, 32, released their <a href=#>collaboration “Feels” earlier this week.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Calvin-Harris-Reveals-Why-He-%E2%80%98Snapped-At-Taylor-Swift-After-Split.jpg><p>Harris describes himself as a “positive guy” despite his past Twitter comments. “It’s very difficult when something I consider so personal plays out very publicly. The aftermath of the relationship was way more heavily publicized than the relationship itself. When we were together, we were very careful for it not to be a media circus. She respected my feelings in that sense. I’m not good at being a celebrity. But when it ended, all hell broke loose. Now I see that Twitter thing as a result of me succumbing to pressure,” he told British GQ. “It took me a minute to realize that none of that matters.”</p><p>Harris and the “Wildest Dreams” singer split in June 2016 after 15 months of dating. A source told <i>Us Weekly</i> at the time <a href=# rel=noopener>that the relationship just wasn’t working anymore.</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“For both of us it was the wrong situation,” Harris told British GQ. “It clearly wasn’t right, so it ended, but all of the stuff that happened afterwards…”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacmZyrtq95x5qpq6GjYr%2BmwsSao6xlp53GbrTEZqqnmaClsqV5wK1krZmpobyzedKwoJ%2BsXZaztbHRZqqppJmperiAmGlsbXFf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./davo-migo-19980916-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Davo Migo (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tiktok-viral-pickle-sweatshirt-conspiracy-theory.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>A Pickle Sweatshirt Has Gone Viral but This Conspiracy Theory Could Explain Why</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

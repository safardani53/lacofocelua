Mike yells that <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vecna</a> was killed by Kas the Bloody-Handed. “So it was thought, my friends,” Eddie told the group.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>TikTok user @paulruddfanclub notes that Kas was a “resurrected lieutenant of Vecna’s that betrayed and killed him. Kas was a human-vampire that fought with a one-handed blade and a shield. So did Eddie.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>According to “traditional vampire law,” as the fan points out, vampires are “turned by bat bites.” As we all witnessed, Eddie was killed by the demobats who attacked him. The fan adds that the “human dies for a little while and then the vampire resurrects the body.” That’s why Dustin <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>would have thought Eddie was dead</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>The fan’s theory also believes that “things not from the Upside Down can’t die in the Upside Down. One should have been killed by the sh*t that happened to him… Yes, he had superpowers but he was just a human being with superpowers.” The fan does point out that “Barb might ruin this theory.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>There has already been some foreshadowing of this theory, according to @paulruddfanclub. The first video that was stitched of the Dungeons & Dragons conversation foreshadows that Vecna didn’t really die, as we saw at the end of the season. While Dustin, Eddie, Max, Lucas, Steve, Robin, and Nancy were at Skull Rock, there was an entire discussion about how to kill Vecna.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Max mentioned driving a stake through Vecna’s heart, which prompted Steve to ask, “A stake? Is he like a vamp? Is he a vampire?” Max said it was just a metaphor, but given Kas’ history with Vecna, this could be a big clue about what may happen in the final season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/stranger-things-wild-eddie-theory-netflix-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>Dungeons & Dragons has always been a major inspiration in the world of Stranger Things. It wouldn’t be a huge stretch for something like this to happen, especially since Eddie became an instant fan favorite. On the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Happy Sad Confused</a> podcast, the Duffer Brothers confirmed that Eddie is definitely dead and his death will have “huge repercussions” in season 5. However, vampires are technically&nbsp;dead.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Joseph Quinn</strong></a> told <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a> that he “wasn’t optioned for another season” beside season 4. “I thought maybe if I did all right, they might invite me back. That didn’t work, clearly!” he added. That could change, too. <strong>Ross Duffer</strong> revealed in an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Collider</a> that the Stranger Things season 5 writer’s room won’t start until August.

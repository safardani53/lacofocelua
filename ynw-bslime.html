He rose to prominence after releasing his songs Hot Sauce, Baby Goat, and Valenslime.</p><p>And YNW Bslime’s real name is Brandon Hunter King.</p><p>He began his journey at 12, but everyone knew Brandon was given the opportunity because of his brother’s YNW Melly influence.</p><p>But to some extent, even that is true because his brother helped him reach the musical world easily.</p><p>But no one can decide the people by mere nepotism; thus, our YNW boy proved that he is a skilled rapper, just like his brother.</p><p>And within a few song releases, people understood that YNW Bslime is a talented rapper.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=YNW_Bslime_Age></span>YNW Bslime Age<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>YNW BSlime, the talented rapper, is 16 years old as of 2023, born on April 10, 2007.

He belongs to the American ethnicity. He was born under the zodiac sign of Aries.</p><p>He didn’t know anything about his father, and his mother raised him as a single mother.</p><p>However, it seems like her mother might have had a bitter relationship with Brandon’s father; thus, she might have decided to hide the information about their father.</p><p>Slime’s mother had his brother Melly when she was only 14 years old. She was just an eighth-grade student, but she welcomed her son.</p><p>Melly was the first son, then YNW Bslime was born, and next comes to the youngest sister. Bslime and his family have faced severe financial difficulties since childhood because she is the family’s sole breadwinner and must care for her three children.</p><p>Thus, YNW Bslime’s childhood was indeed not a fruitful one.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_did_YNW_Bslime_Get_Interested_in_Music></span>How did YNW Bslime Get Interested in Music?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Slime is from a low-income family, so he knows the value of each penny, and he is an avid lover of video games, so he has to pay for the gaming center to play Fortnite.</p><p>But Slime doesn’t have the money, so he asks his brother kindly. Melly would offer him the money, but only if Billy assisted him in recording the song; Slime would say a big yes before being dragged to the recording studio to record his songs.</p><p>Since then, the recording studio has become one of his homes, and he has learned every nuance of rapping from his brother.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=YNW_Bslime_Career></span>YNW Bslime Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.nextbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/YNW-Bslime.jpg><p>YNW Bslime began his career in the year 2019, Bslime attended the Rolling Loud Miami Festival, where the young rapper Yung Bans asked him to sing his brother’s song “Murder on My Mind.”</p><p>Everyone liked his performance, and that energy boosted him to pursue a career in the singing industry. Then, in the same year, YNW Bslime released his debut song, “Hot Sauce,” produced by DJ Choose, and nearly reached a million views.</p><p>Then he released his baby slime freestyle audio, which had low beats. Then he released “Slime Emotions,” which became a smash hit. That song helped him prove his talents to the people.</p><p>In 2019, he released many songs, including Stop Play, Melly Tribute, Homework, Wipe Your Eyes, Anti, Halo, Wait a Minute, and Like That.</p><p>Gucci Belt and I Just Want You were two of the decade’s biggest hits.

He initially fought the murder charge, claiming that police officers were mistreating and assaulting him, but later turned himself in.</p><p>Some people believe Melly is not a real murderer, while others believe he is.

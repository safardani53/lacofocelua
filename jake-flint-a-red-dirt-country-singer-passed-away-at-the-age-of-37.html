Cliff Doyal, Flint’s publicist, broke the news, adding he was also a dear friend, and that the tributes on social media prove that everyone loved him. Doyal continued:</p><p>“I believe a lot of it was because he was a people person with a great sense of humor. He made everyone laugh and made everyone feel at ease.”</p><p>The following day, Flint’s manager Brenda Cline paid homage to him, stating that she was not in a position to comment on Flint’s abrupt death.

The Albertville, Ala., couple welcomed a set of sextuplets to their family — which already consisted of a set of twins and a singleton — and the physical and emotional toll of doubling their family size was a lot to handle.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Considering Season 3 ended in October 2020, fans of the series have been curious whether Sweet Home Sextuplets has been officially canceled or renewed for Season 4.

Courtney and Erin took to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a> to announce the news in July 2021.</p><p>“We have filmed for three seasons and we ended last summer. We ended last July, I think,” Courtney said. “But since then, we have not been filming, we have not had any film crews in our house. And we have decided that what’s best for our family right now is to not continue with the show."</p><p>She continued, "And that's hard to say because you guys are the most loyal and precious fans.

The network approached the couple within a week of announcing the sextuplet pregnancy.</p><p>“We prayed about it and we talked about it and we made the decision that, OK, we’ll do it,” Courtney said. “We’ll give it a shot, and if it ever becomes something that is hard on our family or hard on our kids, then we’ll stop.”</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>What happened was in fall 2020, TLC asked Eric and Courtney if they were up for a Season 4. They initially agreed — although they admitted that filming was a "full-time job" and it would be a challenge to balance it with the demands of parenting nine children. “There are only so many hours in a day, and it was honestly just too difficult,” Eric explained.</p><p>As Eric and Courtney were reconsidering continuing the show, TLC made the call to cancel Sweet Home Sextuplets. “It was almost God’s way of shutting that door,” Courtney said. “Because we were already having reservations.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What are the Waldrops up to today?</h2><p>These days, Courtney still regularly updates <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> with photos and videos of her family so fans can still get their regular dose of cuteness/chaos that is life with nine kids. The sextuplets turned 4 in December 2021 — can you believe it? Meanwhile, twins Wales and Bridge are 10 and their oldest, Saylor, is 13.

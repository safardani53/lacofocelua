Danielle Bregoli, announced the extension of her educational scholarship exclusively with Us Weekly.</p><p>The $1.7 million <a href=#>“Bhad Scholarship,”</a> which the “Hi Bich” artist launched on August 22 in partnership with<a href=#> Educapital Foundation</a>, was created to help 1,000 students enroll in technical and trade schools nationwide and help them receive post-graduate entrepreneurial grants and full-ride scholarships. The launch was met with such success that Bregoli and Educapital have already infused the fund with an additional $1 million.</p><p>Additionally, the Bhad Scholarship is going to be adding more schools and programs. There are now courses for human resources, coding, digital marketing, artificial intelligence and machine learning, journalism, nursing and English as a second language.</p><p>“The Bhad Bhabie Scholarship has exceeded beyond our greatest expectations; and continues to break all previous scholarship records. To that end we are deeply humbled and incredibly proud of all our students!” Dr. Brenita Mitchell, founder of Educapital Foundation, exclusively told Us.</p><p>To their delight, 23,000 students from over 30 different countries applied to the initial scholarship. The original $1 million was already given out to the recipients, allowing them to enroll in their school of choice.</p><p>Bregoli – who rose to fame after her 2016 appearance on <strong><a href=#>Dr. Phil </a></strong>– revealed in August how she originally got the idea to start a scholarship fund.</p><p>“I know that there’s a lot of kids out there that really want to get real jobs and want to work hard, but they just don’t have the money to provide it,” the Florida native told <a href=#>Yahoo Life.</a> “I thought it was an amazing idea.”</p><p>In a press release announcing her scholarship launch, the rapper spoke about how she appreciates her partnership with Educapital.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“While developing this scholarship program, it was great collaborating with Educapital’s <strong>Aisha Rodriguez</strong> and <strong>Dr. Brenita Mitchell</strong>, both amazing women giving amazing opportunities to the next generation of entrepreneurs,” Bregoli shared. “We didn’t want to just give out tuition funds but also help the grads with startup capital to launch their own businesses. I can’t wait to see what these young hustlers do.”</p><p>Education and rapping are not the only thing Bregoli has experienced success with. Apart from achieving viral fame off of Dr. Phil, Bhabie <a href=#>landed a $900,000 Beauty Deal With Copy Cat Beauty</a> in 2019. Plus, she was ranked No. 16 on the <a href=#>Forbes Top Creators 2022</a> list for earning $49 million from the content subscription service OnlyFans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaboJGZeqO0wJugnmWVrcGmusOsZKGdomKvqa3DZqqcoJ%2BhrrO%2Fx6KnZp6lo7FusMStmKKko2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./moment-princess-owusu-ansah-attacks-love-rival-knife.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Horrifying moment teen thug Princess Owusu-Ansah, 18, stabs and pours kettle full of boiling water o</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./aliya-wills-boyfriend-list.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Aliya Wills Boyfriend: Who is Aliya Will Dating?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

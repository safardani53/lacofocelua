The singer uploaded photos from her vacation with her closest friend Liz, in which she wore a golden glow. Positive feedback poured in from the comments area, increasing her self-esteem.&nbsp;A few netizens, however, questioned the singer’s complexion. Some individuals thought she seemed darker. Jessi is said to have blocked one of these persons.</p><p>According to Tiktok, the singer banned her 15-year-old younger sister. She remarked on TikTok:</p><p>“Jessi blocked my younger sister.”</p><p>Hawa took to TikTok to demonstrate how the artist banned her sister, who is also a fan of the performer. The singer looks darker in one of the most recent vacation images, according to Hawa’s younger sister.</p><p>On TikTok, Hawa stated:</p><p>“This is Jessi’s most recent post, and my sister wrote down below, ‘Oh, you seem darker than usual,’ which she does.”</p><p>Netizens were split in their reactions to the singer’s decision to ban a fan for her statement.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>LMFAO apparently Jessi blocked a fan who told her she was blackfishing 😭😭😭 every time I bring it up online I get rabid fans screaming at me</p><p>— 별 (@_byulbit_) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">June 10, 2022</a></p><h2>Netizens had different Opinion over Jessi’s decision to block a young admirer on social media.</h2><p>Following her statement, Hawa’s sister was barred. When she attempts to access the singer’s Instagram account, she receives a message that states, “User not found.”&nbsp;Hawa wondered why the user had vanished. The most ironic aspect, she believes, is that her sister is a fan of a singer. She continued by saying that the singer had taken notice of her sister. The video became viral on TikTok in only one day. As said by Hawa,</p><p>“NO, JESSI, YOU HAVE TO UNBLOCK MY SISTER, SHE’S ONLY 15”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Jessi-1.jpeg alt=Jessi width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The majority of users seem to feel that the ZOOM singer should not have blocked a fan in reaction to such a comment. Many followers believe the singer is a blackfish and that she should embrace her errors.&nbsp;Some suggested that the ZOOM singer is aware of her browned skin since she has previously gotten negative remarks about it. She may have misconstrued it in reaction.&nbsp;Jessi has yet to respond to the growing criticism with a comment. However, once Hawa’s video became viral on TikTok, the singer removed the post.</p><h2>More on the K-pop star under fire</h2><p>The ZOOM vocalist has made a name for herself as a K-Pop sensation. Nonetheless, she was chastised after her reappearance in 2016, mostly for her significant cosmetic surgery. Despite the fact that cosmetic surgery is popular in Korea, particularly in the entertainment business, the singer was chastised for her obvious difference.&nbsp;Despite the displeasure of many netizens for the changes, she proudly asserted it.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Jessi-2.jpg alt=Jessi width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Another reason the singer does not match the K-Pop star cliché is her skin tone. Her brown complexion, which is unusual for a Korean, does not adhere to beauty standards, especially in the entertainment industry.&nbsp;However, colorist remarks urge some tanned heroes to be fairer or even participate in specific diets or skincare techniques to obtain a lighter complexion in a manner that fits the stereotype.&nbsp;Many celebrities who intentionally preserve their natural skin tone have had their photos bleached, as shown on their own fan sites. As a consequence, fans get an incorrect impression of how the idol seems. The ZOOM singer proudly displays her darkened skin and has publicly said that she enjoys tanning. However, she gets more criticism when she travels abroad or goes on vacation since her skin tans.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihnqujnnqqv4yfmJyhnpx6o63CpKOaq5hirqfAxKtkrKCVYq%2Btu8KknJ1lkWLGsMHNoGSbp6livK95yKeqrZmXp66uew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kenny-phillips.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kenny Phillips</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./disney-themed-house-for-sale-mickey-mouse-shaped-pool-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Disney-Themed Home for Sale (With a Mickey-Mouse Pool!)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

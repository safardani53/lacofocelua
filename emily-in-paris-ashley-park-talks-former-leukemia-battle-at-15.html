According to <a href=#>Cancer.net</a>, the five-year relative survival rate for Park’s particular form of leukemia is 67 percent for patients under 20 and 25 percent for individuals above 20. <a href=#>Healthline</a> reports that methods for treating the disease can include chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emily-in-Paris-Ashley-Park-Talks-Former-Leukemia-Battle-at-15.jpg><p>Park said that she “never wanted to be just the Asian girl, just the ‘whatever’ girl,” but then she “got to 16 and was the bald girl and the sick girl.” The <a href=#>Mean Girls</a> actress didn’t want her cancer journey to define her, and she stuck to that mantra while ignoring the potential side-effects of her chemotherapy treatment.</p><p>“I didn’t want to know that I might be infertile or that my heart might stop working or any of that stuff because once you say it, you’re thinking about it,” she explained. “Even though my body beat the disease, if I let it change anything, it’s won.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Park has since come to understand that her fight against leukemia is<a href=#> her “most defining quality as an artist and a person.”</a></p><p>In 2016, the University of Michigan graduate opened how everything changed for her upon learning of her diagnosis. “At that time as a teenager, I [thought], ‘I’m invincible!’ Boys were starting to like me, and I was doing all the things, and my life was great,” she told <a href=#>Playbill</a> at the time. “I was starting to think about college, and then all of that just … just nothing, to the point where you don’t have hair on your body. Everything is taken away, and that is the most human thing that you can ever go through.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaepZmhxm61zWanmqqZqHqiv8elnLJloJa%2FrHnTmqOkq12bvLO5xKtkpZ2loLKutcBmmZqspKGybq3TZmhuZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-keith-strickland-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Keith Strickland Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./derek-kolbaba.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Derek Kolbaba</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

Powell was born and raised in Portland, Oregon, where she gained local fame as a singer, touring the state as the Oregon Victory Girl who sold the winning bonds. As a teenager, she moved to Los Angeles, California, where she signed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Powell's singing, dancing and acting skills have been used for leading and supporting roles in musicals such as A Date with Judy, Royal Wedding, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, and Hit the Deck. In the late 1950s, her film career slowed, causing her to transition into theater with performances in various touring shows as well as two Broadway productions. In 1985, Powell and her fifth husband, former child star Dickie Moore, moved to New York and Wilton, Connecticut, where she occasionally works in the local theater.</p><table class=wikibox readability=3.5><tr readability=7><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>Suzanne Lorraine Burce, April 01, 1929, Portland, Oregon, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Occupation</td><td class=wk_value>Actress, singer, dancer</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Years active</td><td class=wk_value>1944–2004 (acting)</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Children</td><td class=wk_value>3</td></tr></table><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.allfamous.org/people/headshots/jane-powell-2bn7-allfamous.org-1.jpg><p>Movie Actress Jane Powell was born in Portland, Oregon, United States on April 1, 1929.

Hoods and deep pockets are key when it comes to chilly destinations so keep an eye out for those.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In order to help you pick the best puff, we’ve created a virtual closet for you to peruse with options for different budgets, sizes, materials, and designs.

"If you're looking for something basic and functional, Eddie Bauer is a solid choice.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The outer material and lining are made with recycled polyester and recycled nylon respectively, and the fill is 100 percent RDS-certified down, so if you’re looking for sustainable fashion, this jacket could be a good fit.

It has exterior and interior zippered pockets for storing small belongings such as your wallet or passport. The design of the puffer jacket is on the thinner side, making it a good option for athletes as well because it’s not too bulky to run in, and the nylon material is water-resistant.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>XS–XXL<strong> </strong>|<strong> Fill Material:</strong> Unlisted | <strong>Exterior Material:</strong> Nylon | <strong>Silhouette: </strong>Short | <strong>Colors:</strong> 6 | <strong>Water-resistant:</strong> Yes | <strong>Packable:</strong> Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-aritzia-super-world-the-super-puff></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Aritzia Super World The Super Puff</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Aritzia</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Aritzia's puffer jackets are a great choice for a fashion-conscious buyer,” Volpe says. “In all honesty, I don't think the quality is exceptional, but I do know their jackets are versatile and can be dressed up and dressed down for nearly any occasion.” This particular jacket is quite popular, with a durable nylon exterior that’s machine washable and repellent to water and wind.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It’s quite puffy, so it might be tricky to pack for a trip, but it does have a removable hood which could help make it more compact. With an RDS-certified down fill, it’s plush and provides a thick layer of warmth even in the coldest months. And as a bonus, this jacket has 61 different color options, so there is literally something for everyone. “A little simple for my taste, but a great classic, buildable wardrobe staple for the winter months,” Volpe says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>3XS–2XL<strong> </strong>|<strong> Fill Material:</strong> RDS-certified down | <strong>Exterior Material:</strong> Nylon | <strong>Silhouette: </strong>Short | <strong>Colors:</strong> 61 | <strong>Water-resistant:</strong> Yes | <strong>Packable:</strong> Maybe</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-slow-down-puffer-jacket></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Slow Down Puffer Jacket</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you want a simple but effective puffer jacket, slow down and consider this one. Made with 90 percent down, the jacket is quite warm with a thickness that keeps the warmth trapped throughout the day. The material is both soft and durable, holding up to wind, rain, and even snow. It has a cozy hood to add extra protection from wind and other elements and fleece-lined pockets to keep your hands toasty. It’s effective and really well-designed with an overall sleek look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>XS–XXL<strong> </strong>|<strong> Fill Material:</strong> 90% down, 10% feather | <strong>Exterior Material:</strong> Nylon | <strong>Silhouette: </strong>Short | <strong>Colors:</strong> 8 | <strong>Water-resistant:</strong> Yes | <strong>Packable:</strong> Maybe</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-merokeety-winter-puffer-jacket></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Merokeety Winter Puffer Jacket</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Merokeety puffer jacket creates a comfortable, chic aesthetic that can go with many different looks. With a water-resistant, machine-washable fabric, the jacket can also stand a lot of use (which is good because you’ll want to wear it all season long). It adds an extra bit of coziness with the tall neckline which goes up to your chin to help keep wind out. Plus, with 13 colors to choose from, you can go with a more traditional base shade for everyday wear like black, beige, or army green, or create a statement look with bright orange, red, or royal blue.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>XS–XL<strong> </strong>|<strong> Fill Material:</strong> Unlisted | <strong>Exterior Material:</strong> Polyester | <strong>Silhouette: </strong>Short | <strong>Colors: </strong>13 | <strong>Water-resistant:</strong> Yes | <strong>Packable:</strong> Somewhat</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-aritzia-the-super-alps-puffo></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Aritzia The Super Alps Puff₂O™</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Aritzia</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you want a high quality, soft-as-butter puffer jacket that will keep you toasty warm, Aritzia is a good stop. The only hiccup is the price, which usually falls north of most of the puffers we have featured. That said, the Super Alps Puff has many features that make it worth the cost. It has a chic silhouette with a belt to cinch in your waist, a lightweight but incredibly warm goose-down fill and durable nylon exterior.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Our tester described the jacket as “deceptively light” because it has extensive puff, but it doesn’t feel bulky at all. It can even be packed down easily in a suitcase or other travel bag. Since it’s a little longer than classic puffer jackets it keeps your upper thighs warm too. Plus, it has a fleece lining for added warmth, multiple secure pockets, and an adjustable hood. All in all, it’s a versatile puffer jacket that’s long enough to keep you warm and covered, but short enough to not impede any motion.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>3XS–XL<strong> </strong>|<strong> Fill Material:</strong> RDS-certified Goose Down Fill | <strong>Exterior Material:</strong> Nylon, elastane | <strong>Silhouette: </strong>Short | <strong>Colors: </strong>3 | <strong>Water-resistant:</strong> Yes | <strong>Packable:</strong> Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-uniqlo-ultra-light-down-jacket></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Uniqlo Ultra Light Down Jacket</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Uniqlo</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A quality puffer jacket that costs around $70 is a rare find, and when we tested the Uniqlo Ultra Light Down Jacket, it more than proved its worth. The jacket fit true to size but had plenty of room to add layers underneath. It sits right at your hip and effortlessly blends style and function. The puffer jacket has a series of pockets and even comes with a small sack to pack it in — our tester was able to fit it in their day purse. It’s a warm, soft, durable, and all around great winter puffer jacket.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>XXS–XXL<strong> </strong>|<strong> Fill Material:</strong> Down | <strong>Exterior Material:</strong> Nylon, polyester | <strong>Silhouette: </strong>Short | <strong>Colors: </strong>8 | <strong>Water-resistant:</strong> Yes | <strong>Packable:</strong> Yes<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-cropped-puffer-jackets></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-81 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Cropped Puffer Jackets</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-82 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A cropped puffer jacket offers the same benefits of a classic cut but with a little more style (and a little less material). <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Celebrities like Hailey Bieber</a> often rock this trend because it makes a fashion statement without the extra bulkiness. A natural pairing is with high-waisted denim or high-cut skirts that create a balance between the pieces.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-84 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Brands like Lululemon, Alo Yoga, Nike, The North Face, and Amazon all have quality cropped puffer jackets that can serve you some warmth while letting you serve looks. Since cropped jackets are a more stylistic choice, they will generally run a little higher in price —&nbsp;the same concept as paying more for jeans with holes. But, we did find a few options at or under $200, with one discounted at just over $50.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-86 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Get the Look</span></h3><span class=heading-toc id=toc-uaneo-casual-padded-puffer></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-89 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Uaneo Casual Padded Puffer</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-90 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-93 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This cozy puffer jacket from Uaneo is for those who like to wrap up in a blanket and take that feeling outdoors. It’s oversized (size down if you want a more fitted look) and plush without being too bulky. The ribbed cuff keeps cold air from getting in the arm sleeves, and the zippered pockets keep your belongings secure. It’s a simple design, available in a range of basic colors, and it’s on sale for under $50 right now.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-95 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>XS–XL<strong> </strong>|<strong> Exterior Material:</strong> Polyester | <strong>Silhouette: </strong>Cropped | <strong>Colors:</strong> 8 | <strong>Water-resistant:</strong> Yes | <strong>Packable:</strong> Somewhat</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-alo-gold-rush-puffer></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-97 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Alo Gold Rush Puffer</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-98 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Alo</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-101 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re feeling a chic puffer jacket for the cold times ahead, this durable option from Alo Yoga is a winner in our book — a favorite brand of Camilla Cabello, Hailey Bieber, Kendall Jenner, and Victoria Beckham, to name a few. As a stylish and functional piece of outerwear, this jacket is made with a ripstop fabric that’s water-resistant and won’t wear down over time. Fashion stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Elisabeth Kassab</a>loves “this one from Alo.” She says, “I think the simpler the better. I love how it’s cute but also practical.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-103 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It has a drawstring waist so you can adjust the fit depending on the look and feel you’re going for.

It’s true to size, keeping a relaxed fit without looking bulky. It feels lightweight when you’re wearing it, but still provides the warmth and comfort you expect of a puffer jacket. This jacket serves those who prefer fashion and function, and we believe it’s a wardrobe staple you’ll be reaching for every day this season.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-107 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>XS–L<strong> </strong>|<strong> Fill Material:</strong> Synthetic polyester | <strong>Exterior Material:</strong> Ripstop fabric | <strong>Silhouette: </strong>Cropped | <strong>Colors:</strong> 3 | <strong>Water-resistant:</strong> Yes | <strong>Packable:</strong> Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-north-face-hydrenalite-down-hoodie></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-109 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The North Face Hydrenalite Down Hoodie</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-110 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>North Face</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-113 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Volpe appreciates The North Face for being “cute, comfortable, functional, and at times, a little fashionable.” This particular jacket also happens to be extremely packable with a cropped silhouette and thin (but warm) fill that makes it easy to squish down and fold in a bag. And if you want to save space in your suitcase, it’s super lightweight so you could also wear this jacket as an extra layer in the airport.

The design offers versatility with thick pockets on the outside, zippered pockets on the inside, snap buttons, and a zipper closure option.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-123 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You can cinch the waist with a drawstring feature and lift the (removable) hood for additional coverage on windy or rainy days. Our tester said the jacket was “so cute” and loved the dual zipper and snap closures. The material is water-resistant and can be thrown in the washing machine for easy cleaning, but small spills can be easily wiped off: Spilled coffee came off immediately with a damp paper towel.

Our tester said they had a “full range of motion when wearing this puffer to walk the dog, hike, or run errands around the city.” Since it has a slightly oversized fit, it’s a great jacket for layering, and the snap buttons and zipper combination really locks in warmth throughout the day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-141 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The ripstop fabric is quite durable — our tester described it as “thick, water-repellent, and well-made” yet having a “buttery soft” feeling that surprised them. The hood is removable for a more lightweight silhouette, and despite insulating heat well, the jacket is fairly breathable.

It has an oversized feel and is a little bulkier than some others we tested, but it has a chic silhouette with a high neck collar (no hood). Despite the cropped cut, the jacket is quite warm and plush, providing a solid barrier between you and any wind or cold weather. It has a pair of double zippers to allow ventilation at the bottom and zippered pockets to secure any valuables.

Its medium-length silhouette offers some coverage past your torso, and with an attached hood, makes this outerwear the epitome of fashion and function.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-177 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Plus, it’s machine-washable for easy maintenance and comes in a range of several cool tone colors.

PEOPLE senior commerce writer Madison Yauger has the short version of the Aritzia Duvet Puffer, and the satin fabric is incredibly soft and comfortable to wear. It holds up against wind and rain (though not completely waterproof) and it’s super puffy, so you will literally be wrapped in warmth. Despite the puff factor (and feeling like a marshmallow when wearing it), it’s actually lightweight which makes it great for exploring in the winter. And it has a hood to keep your head and ears nice and toasty.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-187 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The fill is goose down, but it’s responsibly sourced (not from manufacturers that use inhumane practices). The silhouette is long so it will go down your knees or a little past if you’re petite, providing extra warmth on particularly cold days. Unlike some jackets, this one doesn’t use a zipper, but rather tiny snaps that fasten about five inches apart down the length of the coat. This small detail adds even more warmth because you’re getting two layers of jacket when it’s closed, as one side fits snugly over the other instead of connecting in the middle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-189 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>2XS–2XL<strong> </strong>|<strong> Fill Material:</strong> RDS-certified down | <strong>Exterior Material:</strong> Satin fabric that’s windproof | <strong>Silhouette: </strong>Long | <strong>Colors:</strong> 7 | <strong>Water-resistant:</strong> Yes | <strong>Packable:</strong> No<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-columbia-pike-lake-ii-long-jacket></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-191 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Columbia Pike Lake II Long Jacket</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-192 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Columbia</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-195 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Columbia is a longstanding favorite for winter apparel due to the quality and designs of its clothing.

Overall, it’s a durable, comfortable, and (despite being warm) breathable puffer jacket that feels “light as a feather.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-253 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>XS–XL<strong> </strong>|<strong> Fill Material:</strong> Synthetic insulation made from recycled plastic water bottles | <strong>Exterior Material:</strong> Polyamide, elastane | <strong>Silhouette: </strong>Short | <strong>Colors:</strong> 2 | <strong>Water-resistant:</strong> Yes | <strong>Packable:</strong> Somewhat<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-before-buying-a-puffer-jacket></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-257 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider Before Buying a Puffer Jacket</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-258 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Materials</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-259 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When considering a puffer jacket, the most important aspect is the material because that’s what keeps you warm. “If you're looking for warmth and cozy comfort, a functional and fashionable puffer jacket should be made of down,” says Volpe. “Premium down is more luxurious and has the best insulation-to-weight ratio of any material. Not only is it super warm, but it's also easy to fold down for your next outdoor adventure.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-261 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Deatherage agrees. “I find the weight of a puffer to be crucial,” he says. “If you are someone who likes to layer, look for a lightweight puffer with a polyfill. If you want a piece that’s more substantial in colder climates I look for a down fill and a lining that provide that extra warmth.” Nylon and polyester are good lining materials that provide substantial warmth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-263 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Volpe adds that you can play around with different material choices depending on your needs and preferences. “I also go for more unique material choices such as leather to make a statement,” she says. “However, if you're the outdoorsy type and you're seeking a puffer jacket for cold weather conditions like a mountain hike, you're going to want to size up for layering and likely purchase synthetic materials so the jacket doesn't lose insulation from water damage in the snow.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-265 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Silhouette</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-266 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The silhouette or cut of a puffer jacket will determine how it fits. Some are a little cinched, which can make for a snug fit when layering with sweaters and other garments. Others are bulkier and not as easily packable. “When purchasing a puffer jacket there are so many things to consider,” says Volpe. “For me personally, I purchase a puffer jacket for fashion (and a little bit for warmth) versus function. Due to this, I look for a fun cropped puffer [like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Lululemon Wunder Puff Cropped Jacket</a>] that's a bit oversized for layering a fun turtleneck or printed sweater underneath.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-268 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Pricing</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-269 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The other consideration that can’t be overlooked is pricing. Puffer jackets — like most outwear — can run the gambit in cost, and if you’re not careful, you can overspend. We’ve worked hard to find selects for every budget but have made sure that the quality is top tier, no matter the price. Some picks are expensive, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Alo<strong> </strong>Yoga Ice Breaker Puffer Jacket</a>, but they offer a high quality and value that matches the price. That being said, our lower-budget picks, like the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Uaneo Casual Padded Puffer</a>, <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Dina Weis Shiny Padded Puffer Jacket</a>, and <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Tsla Packable Accent Puffer Jacket</a>, can also stand the test of time and provide functional fashion to get you through the winter.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-frequently-asked-questions></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-271 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Frequently Asked Questions</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-272 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How should a puffer jacket fit?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-273 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The fit of a puffer jacket comes down to sizing and silhouette, as well as the clothes you’re wearing underneath. “Sizing is always an important part of choosing your puffer,” says Deatherage. “Layering is great for those on the go, especially in the winter months. If you want to use a puffer as an under layer I suggest a more snug size as an appropriate fit. If you want your puffer to be an outer layer, maybe size up to accommodate the rest of your outfit under the piece.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-275 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Are longer or shorter puffer jackets better?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-276 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We’ve included a variety of short puffer jackets and long puffer jackets to suit your needs. “Depending on the climate, long versus short makes a huge difference in the level of warmth you are,” says Deatherage. “I’m a big fan of an open long puffer that can accentuate the rest of an outfit. That being said, a short puffer is the more practical go-to option.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-278 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What is the difference between a puffer jacket and a down jacket?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-279 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While some puffer jackets are made with down, others use a synthetic alternative, which creates a difference between down puffer jackets and non-down puffers. “My vote is always going to be premium down fill for puffer jackets,” says Volpe. “It's softer, higher quality, and just better overall 100 percent.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-281 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That said, not everyone is comfortable with wearing real down for sustainability reasons. “If you are opposed to down fill due to the fact that it’s made of geese and duck feathers, synthetic down fill such as polyester is a fair alternative,” she adds. “One upside to synthetic fill is it's water resistant versus down, which loses insulation when wet.” This makes materials like polyester fill better for machine-washing because it won’t break down like real down can. “Another plus is synthetic fill puffer jackets are more cost effective and affordable,” Volpe says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-take-our-word-for-it></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-283 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Take Our Word For It</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-284 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Madison Yauger</a> is a senior shopping writer who’s covered extensive fashion trends such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>linen pants</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>fall sweaters</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>skorts</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>running shoes</a>.

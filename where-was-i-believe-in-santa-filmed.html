(OK, once it did back in 1962, and it was only a dusting, per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Los Angeles Times</u></a>), but in Hollywood, it sure can. Since I Believe in Santa, a 2022 holiday <a href=#>Netflix</a> movie, was filmed partially in Tinseltown in September of 2021, it’s doubtful that the cast played in real snow during certain wintry scenes.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>However, the magic of moviemaking allowed Christina Moore of <a href=#>That ‘70s Show</a> fame (who plays the lead female character, Lisa), John Ducey (who plays her boyfriend, Tom), as well as the rest of the cast of I Believe in Christmas to enjoy some yuletide fun under the sun. Meanwhile, the romcom was also filmed in another key setting where real snow was on the ground. Read on for more details about the filming locales of the <a href=#>feel-good holiday flick</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where was ‘I Believe in Santa’ filmed?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Lisa, a writer, and Tom, a lawyer, start dating in the summertime after meeting at an Independence Day celebration, and their relationship spans until Christmastime. That’s when, as Lisa predicted, she finds something “wrong” with the seemingly perfect guy she's been coupled up with: He’s super into Christmas. Meanwhile, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she despises the holiday</a> more than any other. And, as the title of the movie suggests, Tom also believes in <a href=#>Santa Claus</a> — yes, as an adult.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">plot of I Believe in Santa</a> then sees Tom trying to convince Lisa that Christmas is indeed happy, not horrible. He invites Lisa and her daughter Ella (Violet McGraw) to join him to check off activities on an ultimate bucket list of holiday fun, including taking in the play A Christmas Carol, watching a Christmas tree lighting, competing in a Santa trivia night (can we play?), getting their <a href=#>holiday baking</a> on, and even enjoying a magical sleigh ride.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where else was ‘I Believe in Santa’ filmed other than Los Angeles?</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>While some of the scenes that feature snow and holiday revelry were filmed in L.A., Tom and Lisa, who are married off-screen incidentally, also filmed scenes for the holiday-themed <a href=#>romantic comedy</a> in and around Denver, Colo., where real snow was on the ground, even in September.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The entire movie was filmed in about three weeks during that month, reportedly, with star and writer-director John (who teamed up with Alex Ranarivelo for this film) documenting much of the process on social media, including setting up production in the mountains, which made for a breathtaking backdrop.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>The cast and crew were also spotted filming in Malibu near the beach, incidentally. All in all, it seems that John and Christina, as well as the other stars of the film, enjoyed diverse sets while shooting I Believe in Santa. From the beach to the city to snow-capped mountains, the project may have felt in part like an extended vacation. OK, or at least from an outsider’s point of view it sure seems that way!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmrpqrXZ56o7HLopyvnV2eu26%2FwKermmWWnrmuscM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./brad-maule.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Brad Maule</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kenny-chesney-the-moment-that-changed-my-life-forever.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Moment That Changed My Life Forever</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

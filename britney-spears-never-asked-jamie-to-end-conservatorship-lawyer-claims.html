They played and worked in the family garden. And every night, Jamie cooked Southern comfort food that the family ate and enjoyed together. In that time, Britney never expressed those words to her father. She’s <a href=#>never asked him to step aside</a>.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jamie-Spears-Lawyer-Insists-Britney-%E2%80%98Never-Asked-Him-to-Step-Aside-From-Conservatorship-Despite-Court-Filings.jpg><p>In August 2020, the singer, 39, stated in court documents obtained by Us&nbsp;that she <a href=#>was “strongly opposed” to her father</a>, 68, remaining as her conservator. Her attorney, <strong>Samuel D. Ingham III</strong>, later stated that the “Toxic” singer is “afraid of her father” and “will not perform as <a href=#>long as her father</a> is in charge of her career.”</p><p>The conservatorship, which began in 2008, has resurfaced due to Hulu’s <a href=#>Framing Britney Spears documentary</a> that details the relationship between Britney and Jamie and the <a href=#>media’s effect on the singer over the years</a>.</p><p>“I understand that every story wants to have a villain, but people have it so wrong here,” Thoreen added on Thursday. “This is a story about a fiercely loyal, loving, and dedicated father who rescued his daughter from a life-threatening situation. People were harming her and they were exploiting her.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She added that Jamie had “saved” the Grammy winner’s life and has “worked tirelessly to protect her” through the years, helping her to regain custody of her sons, Preston, 15, and Jayden, 14, whom she shares with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Kevin Federline</strong></a>.</p><p>“Thanks to Jamie’s efforts, Britney’s estate is now capable of taking care of Britney and her children for the rest of their lives, as long as no one is permitted to exploit or <a href=#>take advantage of her again</a>,” Thoreen added. “[The court] would not have appointed Jamie or kept him on if Jamie weren’t a loving father and grandfather, and if he weren’t a responsible conservator, and he’s all of those things.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabqpmpu6bFjKynnpmiqHqvsdWeqWaZo6CypXnJmqSinV2pvG6xzZ1knKeeqLKzwsCtpqurmJ69brjAsLCeql2YuaK1zKxm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jean-shepherd.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jean Shepherd</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./adrian-petersons-wife-list.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Adrian Petersons Wife: Who is Adrian Peterson Dating?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

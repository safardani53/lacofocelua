Psss … I never mentioned how I beat him in basketball 🏀 and he would cry … no disrespect 🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️!!!” Spears, 42, captioned a video via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> on Friday, December 15.</p><p>While Spears didn’t mention Timberlake, 42, by name, the phrase, “no disrespect,” seems to be in reference to <a href=#>J.T.’s performance in Las Vegas</a> on Wednesday, December 13. Timberlake said the same words before performing “Cry Me a River,” a song he allegedly wrote after he ended his three-year relationship with Spears in 2002. While the lyrics allude to infidelity, the song’s music video also famously features a blonde actress who looks eerily like Spears.</p><p>The pop icons’ past romance came back into the spotlight after the release of Spears’ memoir, <a href=#>The Woman in Me</a>. She detailed quite a bit about their ups and downs in the book, including claiming that she and Timberlake both cheated on each other. However, she felt like Timberlake got the upper hand publicly with the speedy release of “Cry Me a River” after their split.</p><p>“I felt there was no way at the time to tell my side of the story,” Spears wrote of the song. “I couldn’t explain, because I knew no one would take my side once Justin had convinced the world of his version. I don’t think Justin realized the power he had in shaming me. I don’t think he understands to this day.”</p><p>Spears said she was “devastated” by the breakup, and she thought the public looked at her as the “harlot who’d broken the heart of America’s golden boy.”</p><p>Timberlake previously addressed the release of “Cry Me a River” in his 2018 book, Hindsight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Britney-Spears-Seemingly-Claims-Justin-Timberlake-Would-Cry-After-Losing-to-Her-in-Basketball-2.jpg><p>“I’ve been scorned. I’ve been pissed off. The feelings I had were so strong, I had to write it,” he wrote in his memoir. “I translated my feelings into a form where people could listen and hopefully relate to it. People heard me and they understood it because we’ve all been there.”</p><p>Timberlake has <a href=#>remained hush-hush</a> since the release of The Woman In Me, but a source exclusively told Us Weekly that he was “<a href=#>disappointed</a>” with the amount of intimate details Spears spilled.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Justin thought Britney might talk about their ups and downs in more general terms — not air out their very personal, dirty laundry,” the insider told Us in October, adding that the former ‘NSync bandmember “regrets that he hurt Britney.”</p><p>A second source noted that Timberlake was “young” at the time, acontinuing, “He thinks Britney has every right to tell her story and hopes they can move on now.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabqpmpu6bFjKynnpmiqHq0scSmoKefnK56tLTAnZysZZqqwLW1zWaroqWSmr%2BtrcqeZKyZqah6qbGMsKaupJRisLPFjJqdrZ2iYrmwv8innmasn2K1pr6MoqVmmpGouKbAwZqjpWc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./khloe-kardashian-fans-wild-method-fall-asleep-candid-comment.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Khloe Kardashian fans stunned after she reveals the wild method she uses to fall asleep in candid co</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-walking-dead-aaron-safe-place-season-5-episode-11-review.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Aarons Safe Place Revealed As Alexandria Episode Review Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

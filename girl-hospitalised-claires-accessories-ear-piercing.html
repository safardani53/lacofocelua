It's gone!" The earring looked like it had fallen out but had actually become embedded in her ear.</p><p>Concerned Debbie, a kitchen assistant at Sophie's primary school, first took her daughter to the care centre at Halton Hospital.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT0004315637601.jpg><p>There medics tried to remove the earring for an hour but Sophie became&nbsp;"too upset" to have it removed and was finally taken to the Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool, where she was placed under general anaesthetic.</p><p>Mum Debbie is unsure what caused the infection, but is sceptical about the 3 Week Rapid Care Solution that she used daily.</p><p>"It's a waste of money," she said. "If it had worked like it should have done Sophie would never have got that infection."</p><p>She added: "Paying £15 for that solution seems mad when you could probably get a better result from salt water.</p><p>"Claire's really need to up their game and make sure their hygiene procedures and training are up to scratch. And they need to take another look at the solution."</p><h2><strong>Erin Moulton, six</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000431764690.jpg><p>Erin Moulton was left screaming in pain after her earring got "sucked into" her earlobe just a week after getting her ear pierced, her mum claims.</p><p>Julie Ryan from Shepherd's Bush, West London, says she took her daughter to Claire's in Westfield London on August 13 and returned a week later after swelling appeared in both ears.</p><p>Staff at the store told her to head to hospital, but at Hammersmith Hospital Julie was told they did not have the "correct instruments" to remove the earring.</p><p>Finally at&nbsp;Chelsea and Westminster Hospital the screaming child had to have numbing cream applied to her earlobe and was given gas and air for the doctor to push and yank the metal out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT0004317646921.jpg><p>Julie says she complained to Claire's head office but rejected an offer from the chain of a £42 refund plus £42 in-store compensation, describing it as "an insult".</p><p>She told the Sun Online:&nbsp;"My little girl was&nbsp;<span class=il>traumatised</span>&nbsp;and was left in a lot of pain.</p><p>"This is completely irresponsible of Claire's and should not be happening to child of any age. I want parents to be fully aware of this terrible ordeal."</p><h2><strong>Sophia Gordon, six</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000431772324-e1536315907913.jpg><p>Mum Natalia Zapior has told of a "disturbing" scene when she was made to endure the sight of her daughter screaming with pain.</p><p>Her daughter Sophia Gordon had her ears pierced at Claire's in Stafford in August 2017, so that her ears could be healed in time for the school term.</p><p>Natalia, 33, insists she used the £15 Rapid Care solution for six weeks before changing the earrings - taking twice the recommended precaution.</p><p>But after three months her right ear became infected when the butterfly "grew into her ear".</p><p>Doctors put Sophia, just five at the time, on antibiotics before the infection was aggravated and she was sent to A&E.</p><p>But they were unable to extract it and she was taken to the minor injuries clinic in Stafford the next day, where she was put under a local anaesthetic and underwent a 20 minute procedure to have the butterfly cut out.</p><p>"It was terrible, she was in serious pain and it was disturbing to watch," she told the Sun Online.</p><p>"There was loads of blood everywhere. I will never get her ears pierced again."</p><h2>Have you been affected?

The cleaning solution is a joke."</p><p>She says she has phoned 111 and was told to continue cleaning the wound, but says it has started bleeding again and plans to take Molly to her GP.</p><p>"I can't get them undone as they are so tightly screwed on that she screams if I try as it hurts too much," she explained, adding:&nbsp;"I wish we'd never gone, we'll never use Claire's again."</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Response from Claire's</h3></p><p>'Our piercing procedure and all of our piercing instruments, supplies and earrings are designed to promote the safest and most hygienic piercing experience.</p><p>'The rapid after care lotion is dermatologist and paediatrician tested for the effective care of the pierced ear.

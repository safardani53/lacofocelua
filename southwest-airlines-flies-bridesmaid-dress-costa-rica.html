I can’t even imagine … I was just sick to my stomach.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The woman’s friend Taylor Kenney then tweeted at the airline and asked if there was any way to get her friend’s dress on the next flight out from Houston.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“@SouthwestAir help!! My friend is in a wedding on Saturday in Costa Rica but she left her bridesmaids dress here in Houston!” Kenney wrote. “Can we get her dress on flight #1734 tomorrow??? #WorthATry #BestCustomerService.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noreferrer>The airline</a> responded to the tweet, writing “We like where your head’s at,” and asked for more information about the passenger and her dress. Once they agreed to fly the dress to Costa Rica, Kenney and the airline provided updates, including photos of another friend dropping off the dress at the airport and handing it to a Southwest agent.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“UPDATE: The dress has arrived at Houston Hobby,” Southwest Airlines wrote. “(Shoutout to the bridesmaid’s friend Rachel, who dropped it off at the airport this morning. We all need a friend like Rachel.)”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Then, the airline continued to provide updates about the dress, and took pictures of it in its bag on the aircraft. They even created a hashtag for the operation (#RescueTheDress) and allowed the world to track the dress in flight.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The dress arrived safely at the airport in Costa Rica the following day, where Opermann was able to retrieve it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Ladies and gentlemen, it has arrived,” Southwest wrote. “Operation #RescueTheDress: COMPLETE!”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Oppermann even provided an image of her wearing the dress at the destination wedding as she stood next to the bride.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Yep. That was totally worth it,” Southwest wrote alongside the photo.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After the exchange gained traction on social media, some Twitter users were confused why the dress in the picture was white while the dress that was originally pictured was red with white stripes. However, Southwest was quick to clear up the controversy after one user asked “Is it just me or did the dress lose its stripes on the flight?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“No stripes lost!” the airline wrote. “We appreciate your eye for detail. If you look closely, the white dress (the actual bridesmaid dress!) can be seen behind the striped one. ‘Cause if you’re sending one dress, might as well send two, right?!”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Southwest Airlines did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment, but told Today in a statement that they didn’t think twice about sending the dress.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“When we saw the call for help on Twitter @southwestair, we knew we had to say yes to the dress,” a representative for the airline said. “This bridesmaid story has a happy ending, and we’re thrilled to play a part in making this special day a success. Cheers to the happy couple — and one relieved bridesmaid — from the LUV airline!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6Snrrexy2iqqK2kncSmv9NmmKKqnJ67pr%2BMn6OinaNir7O1w56qppmZmXqlvsSsqmabn6jBonnRopqaZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./egztlyff-h5-9lkjzt-yehhadsh4q-3.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Stream Movies, Shows &amp;amp; Live TV</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kaya-jones-photos-pussycat-dolls-member-pics.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Photos Of Former Pussycat Dolls Member Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

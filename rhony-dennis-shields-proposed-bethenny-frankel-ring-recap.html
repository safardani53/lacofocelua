She further explained, “I loved him so much and we were family and my daughter was close with him and I knew him for so many years.” Then, she revealed that Dennis had asked her to marry him, and it was something she didn’t tell anyone. “He proposed on April 25,” she shared before showing Dorinda the massive engagement ring he gave her — one that she wore throughout this week’s episode.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“I didn’t know that,” Dorinda said, before adding, “Aw, that’s sad”. And Bethenny agreed. “It’s very sad,” she repeated through tears. “… I kept it to myself because I didn’t want another circus of my life … We had our own private engagement and our own private, like, ‘Oh my God, we’re gonna do this.’” And when Dorinda asked if Bethenny’s daughter <strong>Bryn</strong> knew, the Skinnygirl mogul said, “He bought Bryn a ring, too”.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Earlier in the episode, Bethenny also talked about her engagement when <strong>Tinsley</strong> noticed her ring at <strong>Barbara</strong>‘s clambake. During her interview, Bethenny said, “Dennis and I went out to dinner in April [2018], and he proposed. And it’s funny because he said to me, ‘Well, did you say yes?’ And I said, ‘Well, I love you and I can’t believe you did this, but we have to talk about some conditions and some terms and how things are going to change, issues I’ve had with partnership and consistency,’ and it was all very complicated. It wasn’t what a natural engagement should be. So, our engagement was on ice.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Meanwhile, <strong>Ramona</strong> was confronted by Luann about spreading rumors at the same clambake, so she quickly left. But not before she filled a doggie bag with expensive lobsters, and like us, many of the ladies raised their eyebrows at it. No joke — she was only there for 30 minutes before leaving with half the food from the buffet table. “She stays for half an hour and then she takes a lobster with her,” Luann said. “I’ve never seen anything like it!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>But that wasn’t Ramona’s only faux pas this week. Once Ramona, <strong>Sonja</strong> and Tinsley got back to Dorinda, who was hanging out alone at Ramona’s Hamptons house after getting disinvited from the clambake, their conversation turned to a lawsuit that sparked Luann’s relapse and second stint in rehab. “That lawsuit won’t be dropped until everything is finalized,” Sonja said. “But that’s why I asked Bethenny to help her with Dennis and all that ’cause you need a smart guy doing that stuff.” And that’s when Ramona took a jab at Dennis, who died just a few weeks before this episode was filmed. “How smart can Dennis be? I mean, he was on drugs,” she said. Yes, she really said that. Fortunately, Ramona took to social media on March 20 (hours before the episode aired) to apologize, but we don’t think Bethenny will ever forget what she said. Even for Ramona, that was low.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Oh, and Sonja later threw a party to celebrate a recent cover shoot for a fashion magazine, where Dorinda and Luann finally came face to face with each other. However, their confrontation won’t air until next week!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH10e5FpZqugn6PGbrDEp6Wiq12otaqxy52qZqiipL2wv8SdZJudpJ2yr7rYZp2rmZ6gsq150aKloGWimrCivI4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kelley-ohara-wife-5133947.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Facts About Her Fiancee Kameryn Stanhouse Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bel-air-series-everything-to-know-about-fresh-prince-reboot.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bel-Air Series: Everything to Know About Fresh Prince Reboot</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

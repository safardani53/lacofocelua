From her description, it sounds as though their relationship was unhealthy before the alleged sexual assault took place.</p><p>Timothy (who, yes, is a woman named Timothy) described spending two nights in a row shooting down sexual advances from Martinez, who ultimately got her high and then continued to pressure her.</p><p>Despite having said no and also protesting that she had a boyfriend, Timothy says that she finally assented to allow Martinez to touch her arm and breasts but nothing else.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>She says that Martinez took it further, despite her saying "no" multiple times, molesting her, performing oral sex on her without her consent, and penetrating her with an object.</p><p>What she describes is rape, folks.</p><p>(This is a photo of Timothy and Melanie, taken back in 2014)</p><p>Before Timothy Heller ever came forward with her full story about Melanie Martinez, she tweeted:</p><p>"What if I have my own story of abuse but I’m scared to ruin the person’s life and I still love them in a f–ked up way and the public really really loves them."</p><p>She didn’t name any names or even hint, but, as she <a href=#>tells Newsweek</a>, Melanie Martinez tried to contact her just 20 minutes after she sent out the tweet.</p><p>"I started sobbing when I saw [Melanie]&nbsp;was calling me, and I blocked her."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>She describes that as her first time "hearing from" Martinez in over a year. She also tried to contact Heller’s boyfriend.</p><p>Then, in text messages (which Newsweek also viewed), Martinez said that she had "dreamed about" Timothy Heller recently — explaining that this, in fact, was why she was reaching out to her.</p><p>She also suggested the name of a "healer" named Raven.</p><p>Timothy Heller wasn’t buying it:</p><p>"Suggesting a healer after I said I might tell my story,&nbsp;saying she dreamt about me, it’s condescending."</p><p>Among other things.</p><p>"What, she’s invested in my well-being all of a sudden? And it has nothing to do with that tweet?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>(This is a photo of Melanie from 2015, on the night in question)</p><p>Timothy Heller explains why, for two years, she was so reluctant to come forward:</p><p>"Her fans see her as this angel who understands them."</p><p>(I don’t know that I’ve ever met a Melanie Martinez fan, ever, in my life, but I’ll take Heller’s word for it)</p><p>"So I assumed no one was going to take me seriously if I explained what she did."</p><p>It is all too common — almost universal — for survivors of sexual assault and sexual abuse to doubt that their claims will be taken seriously.</p><p>Unfortunately, it’s all too often that they’re right. How many #MeToo stories have involved people’s friends or managers telling them to keep quiet?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"I’ve been reading all the #metoo stories, and though I’m obviously in support of the people coming forward, I wasn’t sure if my story of being assaulted fit."</p><p>It does, but we understand her hangups.</p><p>"People don’t really talk about this."</p><p>So many people still have this image of sexual assault being something that happens to women who jog alone or during a home invasion. Those can happen, but the vast majority of sex abuse is perpetrated by those you know, trust, or even love.</p><p>"But I know now that assault happens this way all the time."</p><p>Sadly true.</p><p>"I loved her even after it happened, and I had this sick need to protect her, which I’ve learned is very common for victims of assault, especially those hurt by their family or friends."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"We remained friends for a while, but it was strange, obviously. I think I was invalidating my own experience for so long because she’s not a man."</p><p>It’s said that something in the area of 10% of sexual predators are women. Too often, their crimes are not taken seriously by the public.</p><p>"Plus, she was my friend, and I sat with what happened in silence because I didn’t want to be malicious."</p><p>Some people are silenced because they feel like speaking out is somehow "bad manners." Accusing a sexual predator doesn’t make you the bad guy.</p><p>Kind of the opposite, actually.</p><p>Heller reveals that Melanie Martinez ultimately ended their friendship with an unceremonious text message:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"I just can’t have anything stopping me or distracting me from getting where I need to get," Martinez texted.&nbsp;</p><p>"I don’t have time to have those distracting things in my life. The next couple of years are pretty crucial for me and I need to focus."</p><p>Timothy Heller explains it like this:</p><p>"She saw some psychic who told her she had to cut people out of her life if she wanted to win a Grammy."</p><p>Some people are especially anxious about coming forward with accusations regarding same-sex assaults.</p><p>While it’s good to be conscious of anti-gay stigma (there are still people who eagerly portray LGBT people as predators who want to "convert" children), there are important things to remember:</p><p>One: Rape is rape.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>It is always evil. The end.</p><p>Two:</p><p>When we’re talking about someone like <a href=#>Kevin Spacey and his alleged assaults</a>, spanning decades, remember that Anthony Rapp is an out gay actor.</p><p>It’s often (though not always) the case that a gay predator’s victims are likely to be gay themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>So calling out a rapist isn’t homophobic.&nbsp;</p><p>Shout-out to Timothy Heller for sharing her story with the world. That cannot have been easy, but it was profoundly brave.</p><a href=#><img width=1706 height=2560 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/weinstein-scandal-which-powerful-men-are-accused-of-sexual-misco-scaled.jpg alt="Hollywood Sex Scandal: Who's Been Caught?

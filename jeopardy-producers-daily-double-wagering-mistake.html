More times than not, people get Daily Doubles correct.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on Jeopardy!">Read more on Jeopardy!</h2><h2>'DON'T MAKE THOSE TINY WAGERS'</h2><p>"I just want to remind everyone. Please wager big on your Daily Doubles.</p><p>Sarah Foss chimed in: "If you go on the show we don't wanna see you making those tiny Daily Double wagers."</p><p>The nine-time and<a href=#> 2016 Tournament of Champions</a> winner added: "I have a strategic point of view here.</p><p>"Which is that 1. You've already played a couple of clues in the category, probably."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>They continued: "You kind of get what the writers are asking for. You know where it is on the board so you get the level of difficulty.</p><p>"[And] You have way more information than you do on Final Jeopardy. Why not bet more there on these Daily Doubles?</p><p>"When there are more clues on the board you can make it up [if you miss it]."</p><p>"Than ending up in a close Final Jeopardy and having to bet a ton of money and ending up in a situation where you might not be able to get it?" they added.</p><h2>'WHERE DID HE PULL THAT NUMBER FROM?'</h2><p>The <a href=#>frustrating bet</a> to which the insiders were referring took place on May 30's episode.</p><p>Nathan Dennis - who had revealed he tried out for <a href=#>Jeopardy! </a>three times - landed on a Daily Double and had $7400, while returning champ Ilhana had $8400, and Diandra had only $2800.</p><p>Host&nbsp;<a href=#>Mayim Bilaik</a>, 47, reminded Nathan: “You're $1000 behind Ilhana in second place, how much would you like to wager?”</p><p>He replied: “$1356,” to which Mayim chuckled and replied in a slightly sarcastic voice: “Alright, here’s your clue."</p><p>Under the category Cat Breeds it read: “This place associated with a tiger subspecies is also the name of a beautiful cat breed.”</p><p>Nathan was correct with the answer: “Bengal,” but his small wager didn't really help him jump to a wide lead when it could have.</p><p>He wound up losing the game.</p><p>“Weird bet from Nathan," one fan put it plainly on Reddit.</p><p>“That $1356 Daily Double wager ended up being a huge factor, as he finished just in touching distance of first place heading into Final Jeopardy.&nbsp;</p><p>"I wonder where he pulled that number from LOL," wrote another.</p><p>“I feel like he was picking his bet sizing using numbers of personal importance instead of using numbers of strategic importance, chances of winning be damned," accused a third.</p><p>“I don't understand why someone in second place in what was then a close game wouldn't wager at least enough to take the lead," wrote a fourth.</p><p>A&nbsp;<a href=#>Daily Double</a>&nbsp;allows a contestant to bet however much they want from their existing score.</p><p>There are three crucial hidden clues on the clue board per game.</p><p>Viewers, who watched the recent&nbsp;<a href=#>Masters' contestants</a>&nbsp;go all in upon finding them, know how important Daily Doubles can be.</p><h2>WHAT IS: THE JEOPARDY! HOST SCHEDULE</h2><p>Ken wrapped the thrilling&nbsp;<a href=#>Jeopardy! Masters</a>&nbsp;special, which was&nbsp;<a href=#>won by James Holzhauer</a>.</p><p>Underdog&nbsp;<a href=#>Mattea Roach, 24, came in a close second</a>&nbsp;last month.</p><p>Mayim, who is Ken's co-successor to&nbsp;<a href=#>Alex Trebek</a>,&nbsp;is finishing out the regular season until the summer.</p><p>Ken won't be seen until the&nbsp;<a href=#>2023 Tournament of Champions</a>,&nbsp;which will kick off Season 40 in September, barring the last week of Season 39.</p><p>Many&nbsp;Jeopardy!&nbsp;viewers who tuned in last week were not overly impressed with Mayim and her hosting style.</p><p>In particular, they noticed that the star&nbsp;<a href=#>takes too long to respond to contestants</a>&nbsp;when they give their responses.</p><p>Taking to Twitter, one viewer fumed: "As hard as I have tried I do not care for Mayim Bialik hosting Jeopardy!. She pauses before she answers and it drives me crazy. And I’m spoiled from the Masters."</p><p>A second person agreed and replied: "My sentiments exactly. I think she waits for somebody in her ear to tell her whether the answer is accepted and it annoys me to no end. Then there’s the Masters hangover I have also. Ken Jennings has humor & charisma."</p><p>Earlier last week, other viewers&nbsp;<a href=#>begged Jeopardy! producers to address the issue.</a></p><p>Many people expressed that since Mayim isn't fast enough to mark the responses right or wrong, contestants have started adding to their responses while they wait for her to rule.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>One player did so twice last week, including on a $6,000 Daily Double.</p><p>However, thankfully the additions he made to his responders did not render him incorrect.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/peggy-sirota-abc-via-getty-742173005-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/fans-accuse-mayim-bialik-allowing-822429385-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/live-audience-erupts-laughter-host-820476166-2.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwY2V%2Bc4KWaKGep6CWv6XFjKmpqJylmLKzv4ydmKKkqWKxsMHBpZxmr5GcsrO1zaBkpqGjqa6ssY4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./simon-delaney-and-lisa-muddiman-relationship-wiki-kids-and-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Simon Delaney And Lisa Muddiman Relationship: Wiki, Kids And Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gordon-ramsay-shocks-fans-floppy-haircut.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Gordon Ramsay shocks fans as he shows off his floppy haircut in teenage throwback snap The US Su</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

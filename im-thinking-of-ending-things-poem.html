Jessie Buckley's female protagonist recites the poem in the movie, claiming that she's written it herself.&nbsp;</p><p>Later on in the story, though, we discover that the poem is actually part of a book of poetry that her boyfriend Jake owns. Like <a href=#>much of the film</a>, the poem focuses on how it feels to be lonely.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Bonedog" features lines like "Coming home is terribly lonely so that you think of the oppressive barometric pressure back where you have just come from with fondness because everything’s worse once you’re home." It describes the feeling of being alone, whether there are people around you or not. In its way, the poem illuminates the loneliness of living with only your own thoughts.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' is about knowing other people.</h2><p>The poem reinforces the notion at the center of the movie that it's impossible to know another person the way you know yourself. As the movie suggests, it's impossible to know another person's thoughts, and so although you may think you know someone, you never really can. "Bonedog" is about that loneliness, and about how dreary it can be to live with the repetition of a normal life.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Although there's plenty of beauty in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I'm Thinking of Ending Things</a>, the movie is also deliberately confusing. It's a puzzle where you feel like you must be missing a few pieces. In spite of the movie's general inscrutability, though, it's possible to grasp the ideas the movie plays with, including the loneliness described in "Bonedog."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Bonedog' isn't the only thing referenced in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things'.</h2><p>In addition to "Bonedog", Charlie Kaufman also packs in a number of other references to a variety of art forms. Jessie Buckley's character recites large sections from Pauline Kael's review of A Woman Under the Influence, and there are also a number of references to Oklahoma! scattered throughout the film. All of these combine to make the viewer feel delirious and the effect may be off-putting to some people looking for something more conventional.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm Thinking of Ending Things has already been interpreted in a number of ways, but one of the most common interpretations is that like the book it's based on, this story takes place inside the head of a lonely janitor who we see throughout the film. If that's the case, then "Bonedog" only reinforces that man's loneliness and his feelings of hopelessness as he goes about his life.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Like the other references in the film, the poem is just something that the janitor read and enjoyed. It's trapped in his head, just like every other character in the film.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnrpuwMeipaShnpx6sLKMnqWdoZ6cerW0yKeerGWgpLKu</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alina-li.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alina Li</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

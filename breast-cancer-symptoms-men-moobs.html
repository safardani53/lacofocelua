the first organisation for male <a href=#>breast cancer</a> in the UK.</p><p>James was just 36 when he was diagnosed with <a href=#>cancer</a> on February 23, 2023, and was so dazed that he barely noticed that he had sat on an ant's nest waiting for the bus home.</p><p>He was left feeling even more isolated as all the support documents he was given were targeted at women.</p><p>One of the pieces of advice on the first leaflet he opened was “wear a loose fitting bra”, and <a href=#>NHS</a> consultants spoke about how treatment had worked on women.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Health</h2></p><p>Around 400 men a year are diagnosed with <a href=#>breast cancer</a>, and the disease can often be more aggressive.</p><p>Traditionally, men who get it tend to be over the age of 60, and James was referred for treatment by his GP just to be safe.</p><p>After diagnosis, he was initially offered a <a href=#>mastectomy</a>, as that was the usual treatment route for women.</p><p>Doctors also didn’t know if he’d be entitled to a reconstruction on the NHS like women, as it wasn’t seen as vital.</p><p>But it turned out he didn’t actually need to undergo such invasive surgery, as <a href=#>male breast cancer behaves differently to the female kind</a>.</p><p>Doctors also concluded that James’ cancer wasn’t as serious as they first thought and that his raised lymph nodes were a result of an underlying infection.</p><p>James was put onto a 20-cycle course of <a href=#>chemotherapy</a> and is set to undergo a central excision on his right breast - where doctors cut out the cancerous and some surrounding flesh as well as his nipple.</p><p>“Everything made me feel like no one knew what was going on,” James told The Sun.</p><p>“I didn’t know any other men that had it, and everything I was told and given was all based around women.</p><p>“There was no one to talk to, and I didn’t feel comfortable speaking to female breast cancer survivors because I didn’t want to take away from their experience.</p><p>“Everything I was given about my cancer was aimed at females, which made it hard to process what was going on.”</p><p>I realised I couldn’t let anyone else go through what I have alone</p><span class=quote-credit>James Richards</span><p>As a result, James decided to set up moobs, because he didn't want anyone to be left feeling how he did.</p><p>It aims to provide connection to other men diagnosed with the cancer, so they feel less alone, as well as educating men to check their own breasts for any signs and <a href=#>symptoms</a>.</p><p>“The numbers may sound low, but each of the 400 people have a family and a life,” James said.</p><p>“I realised I couldn’t let anyone else go through what I have alone when I had the ability to do something about it.</p><p>“Catching male breast cancer early is so important because it is more treatable.</p><p>“It’s incredible there is so much support out there for women, it’s just a shame that male breast cancer sufferers are left to feel alone and isolated.</p><p>“I don’t want someone to die because they simply don’t have the information that they could get breast cancer.”</p><h2>CHECK YOUR PECS</h2><p>He also hopes that he will achieve charitable status in the next 12 months and be able to help fund research into male breast cancer.</p><p>James discovered through a genetic test that he had the <a href=#>BRCA-2 gene</a>, which meant he is at higher risk of developing <a href=#>pancreatic</a> or <a href=#>prostate cancer</a> as well.</p><p>It was yet another thing he didn’t realise men could carry.</p><p>“If someone knows there is breast cancer in their family, they should get checked for the gene, no matter their gender,” he said.</p><p>“It gives you the power to make a decision and be vigilant with your health.</p><p>“Finding cancer earlier gives you a better chance.”</p><p>James and moobs have the backing of TV doctors <a href=#>Zoe Williams</a> and <a href=#>Amir Khan</a>.</p><p>Dr Amir: “As the most common type of cancer diagnosed in the UK, we’re all aware of the dangers of breast cancer when it comes to women; however, often overlooked are the around 400 cases of the disease diagnosed in men.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“Without raising awareness of the disease -

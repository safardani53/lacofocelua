He had a record of .300/.381/.446 hits with seven home runs and 27 RBIs.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Eventually, the Indians added Tyler Naquin to their 40-man roster after the 2015 season.</span></p><p><strong>You might be interested in another Cleveland Indians player, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Francisco Lindor Bio: Age, Career, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Instagram Wiki</a>.</strong></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Cleveland Indians |&nbsp; </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Major League Baseball</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After the end of the 2015 season, Naquin stayed at the Cleveland Indians’ facility in Arizona to participate in strength training.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Shortly afterward, he competed for a spot on the Indians’ 25-man roster in 2016 during spring training.

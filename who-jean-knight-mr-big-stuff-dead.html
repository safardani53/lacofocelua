Thomas</a>, Freddy Fender, and Gene Summers, among others.</p><p>After signing to a label, Knight dropped her legal last name, Caliste, and adopted the stage name "Knight."</p><p>She felt as though Caliste was too difficult for audiences to pronounce.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>While Knight was able to make a name for herself in local markets around New Orleans, she struggled to gain nationwide recognition across the <a href=#>US</a>.</p><p>That all changed in 1970 when she was discovered by songwriter Ralph Williams.</p><p>In May 1970, using Williams' connections, she recorded Mr. Big Stuff at Malaco Studios in Jackson, <a href=#>Mississippi</a>.</p><p>She recorded her hit single at the same session as Groove Me by fellow New Orleans singer King Floyd.</p><p>Knight then performed the single on <a href=#>Soul Train</a> on December 11, 1971.</p><p>It became one of her biggest hits ever and was nominated for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance at the 1972 <a href=#>Grammy Awards</a>.</p><p>Mr. Big Stuff didn't win the Grammy but was runner-up to <a href=#>Aretha Franklin's</a> Bridge Over Troubled Waters.</p><p>The song is addressed to an egotistical man, nicknamed Mr. Big Stuff.</p><p>Knight acts as a female narrator, who quickly shows that she's not interested in his expensive cars and fancy clothes, instead demanding that the man return her love for him.</p><p>The catchy chorus includes the lyrics: "Mr. Big Stuff / Who do you think you are / Mr. Big Stuff / You're never gonna get my love."</p><p>The song eventually reached the second spot on the <a href=#>Billboard</a> Hot 100.</p><p>It was also certified double platinum and was the number-one soul single of the year.</p><p>The song had longevity, appearing in various <a href=#>TV</a> shows and movies in the 1980s and 1990s.</p><p>In a <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">2002 interview</a>, Knight revealed: "Mr. Big Stuff is better to me now than thirty-one&nbsp;years ago."</p><p>“All I have to do is sit at home and wait for the mailman."</p><p>In 2007, Knight was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame.</p><p>That same year, another one of Knight's songs, Do Me, appeared in the <a href=#>Judd </a>Apatow-produced movie, <a href=#>Superbad</a>, starring <a href=#>Jonah Hill</a>, Michael Cera, and <a href=#>Emma Stone</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What was her cause of death?</h2><p>On Sunday, November 26, 2023, <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a> reported that the famous soul singer had <a href=#>passed away</a>.</p><p>They attributed this report to a press release that had been circulating <a href=#>X</a>, formerly Twitter, over the last week.</p><p>The <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a> states that the singer passed away on Wednesday, November 22, 2023.</p><p>It is currently unknown whether the singer died from natural causes, or for other reasons, like a recent illness.</p><p>Knight was 80 years old at the time of her passing.</p><p><a href=#>Tributes quickly poured in</a> on <a href=#>social media</a> as fans mourned the famous singer.</p><p>The press release also asked for the public's privacy.</p><p>"The family of Jean Knight kindly requests privacy during this difficult time and expresses heartfelt gratitude for the love and support from fans."</p><p>At this time, no public funeral arrangements have been made or publicized.</p><img

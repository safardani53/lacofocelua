She jumped on board for Season 10 and is already making quite the impression on the crew and the fans.</p><p>Onboard, Camille is lacking in motivation and appears to prefer twerking over working. But despite her lackadaisical attitude, viewers are still curious about her life. One thing people are dying to know about is her relationship status. Does <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Camille Lamb</a> have a boyfriend or is she bound to the sea? Let's get into it.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Camille Lamb from 'Below Deck' have a boyfriend?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As of the time of this writing, Shea and Camille do not follow each other on Instagram, which confirms our theory that Camille is single and ready to mingle. Perhaps she deactivated her old account and started a new one in order to keep the linked photos off various websites. Or maybe she has a professional Instagram for her music, and now Below Deck, and a private one which she opted to get rid of. Who can say?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Shea Patterson didn't stay a quarterback at Ole Miss for long.</h2><p>It's possible that Camille and Shea parted ways after he left Ole Miss. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Clarion Ledger</a> reported that in 2018, Ole Miss was "hit with the second year of a postseason ban by the <a href=#>NCAA</a>" for various violations. Because of this, rising seniors like Shea could transfer without issue. That's when he landed at the University of Michigan for the next two years.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Shea was signed by the Kansas City Chiefs in 2020 as an undrafted free agent. Sadly, his NFL career didn't last long as he was waived in July. His time as quarterback didn't end there when Shea returned to <a href=#>Michigan</a> in February 2022 to play for the United States Football League (USFL), via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SB Nation</a>.</p><p>"Head coach Jeff Fisher and the Michigan Panthers had the No. 1 overall selection and selected former Michigan Wolverines quarterback Shea Patterson," said the outlet.</p><p>Other than being a great quarterback, some felt that choosing Shea was a strategic move knowing that he could bring Michigan fans to the game. It's too bad Shea and Camille couldn't make it work. Guess astroturf doesn't go well with the ocean.</p><p>Below Deck airs on Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmK6utculnGakkaKvbq7EpaawZZSasKx5waiwn6qZmrul</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jessa-duggar-how-does-she-feel-about-jinger-wearing-pants.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Does She Feel About Jinger Wearing Pants?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bet-awards-2015-list-of-winners.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>BET Awards 2015: List of Winners!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

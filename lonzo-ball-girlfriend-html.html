Garcia is a soccer player. However, not much about her playing career and details like what position she plays are&nbsp;known.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The couple has a daughter named Zoey Christina Ball, who was born in&nbsp;2018.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Lonzo Ball, Denise Garcia, and Daughter Zoey Christina&nbsp;</h2><p>The longtime&nbsp;boyfriend and girlfriend, <a href=# rel=follow>Ball</a> and Garcia, are natives of Chino Hills, California. They studied at the same school, and it is where their love affair first began and later prospered. Since then, the couple has seen a lot of ups and downs in their relationship, having split in 2018. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, as per multiple reports, they reconciled two years later.&nbsp;</p><p>In one episode of the reality show&nbsp;Ball in the Family, Ball's girlfriend&nbsp;Garcia, who was pregnant at that time, was given an ultrasound to see how the baby is doing. At that moment, the basketballer&nbsp;told everyone that their kid would be named Zoey Christina Ball.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Their daughter Zoey was born on July 22, 2018, and the news of her birth was announced by her father on his official Twitter account.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>However, Garcia's pregnancy was a hot topic at the time, as it was understood to be unplanned. Many even accused her of using pregnancy as a tool to rope the famous basketball player.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The show, which premiered on August 29, 2017, on Facebook Watch, showcases the life of the Ball family. As of now, the show has run for six seasons.</p><p>Furthermore, as per Ball, the birth of his daughter&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">changed his mindset on life</a>. During his appearance on <a href=# rel=follow>LeBron </a>James'&nbsp;The Shop,&nbsp;Ball explained how Zoey's birth caused&nbsp;him "to start taking control" in life. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In the show, he said,</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>I got to look out for a little one that’s mine, that I brought into the world. So, I mean, when she was born, that’s when I started thinking about it.&nbsp;</p><h2>Ball and Girlfriend Garcia's Break Up</h2><p>In an episode of the&nbsp;Ball in the Family&nbsp;show, aired in 2018, Garcia talked about the couple being "just parents." "He's Zoey's dad," she stated.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>When the show's producer asked her if there's a future between the two, she replied, "I mean, I just want us to both be happy, whatever that means. If it's us together, then fine. But if it's not, it's not." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>All this started after rumors suggested that something was not going right between the two. Around the time of the episode, Ball and his girlfriend had a feud on Instagram.&nbsp;</p><p>There were rumors that Ball has been dating another girl. However, the claim lacked credibility and wasn't justified.</p><h2>Their Reunion</h2><p>After a brief stint, the athletic couple was back, dating each other. In an October 2020 episode of the&nbsp;Ball in the Family,&nbsp;they confirmed to have put aside their misunderstanding.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>According to Garcia, they both seem to have grown and learned from their mistakes. She confessed, "no matter has happened between us, like no matter how ugly it gets, like we always find a way back together."</p><p>In 2021, a video posted on Instagram story showed Ball's girlfriend Garcia <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sleeping in his bed</a>. This was enough for their followers to believe that peace was made between the two.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKSfo8ewecGao6Vll56%2FrbLRopynnF6dwa64</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./towie-girls-chloe-sims-lauren-pope-georgia-kousoulou-and-megan-mckenna-look-sensational-as-they-strip-down-to-bikinis-to-film-the-shows-gold-party-and-amber-dowding-poses-naked.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Towie's Georgia Kousoulou flashes major sideboob as she hits glam Gold Party with Megan McKenna, Lau</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kendall-jenner-shows-major-side-boob-plunging-jean-romper.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kendall Jenner shows off major side boob as model nearly spills out of plunging jean romper in sexy</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

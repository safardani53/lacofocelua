The scent, which remains nameless at this time, was crafted by Beyoncé in France and features top notes of clementine and golden honey mixed with rose absolute and jasmine samba. The base of the fragrance includes Namibian myrrh and golden amber.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The product will be “encased in art,” Beyoncé shared, and will retail for $160 for a 1.7-ounce bottle. Eager fans can pre-order the scent and can expect it to ship by November. Shoppers will receive a “special gift” with the purchase.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Beyoncé’s <a href=#>return to perfume</a> comes after she released her first-ever fragrance, <a href=#>Heat</a>, in 2010. The spray, which is packaged in a sexy red bottle, features a musky amber smell mixed with almond macaroon, blush peach and honeysuckle nectar. The perfume currently retails for $88 on Amazon.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s2>It appears Beyoncé has been busy building a beauty empire. In May, she <a href=#>teased a haircare line</a> just days afte</span><span class=s1>r kicking off her <a href=#>Renaissance&nbsp;World Tour</a>. The singer posted a carousel that included a photo of her sitting at a beauty vanity, holding a curling wand in her hand. Elsewhere in the snap, an array of unlabeled products could be seen on a counter. The jars, which appear to be spray bottles, were filled with a golden liquid.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>In the second slide, a young Beyoncé is photographed getting her tresses styled with curling rods. In the final post of the slideshow, Beyoncé opened up about the collection.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“How many of y’all knew my first job was sweeping hair in my mama’s salon?” Beyoncé began. “Destiny’s Child got our start by performing for clients while they were getting their hair done. I was exposed to so many different kinds of entrepreneurial women in her salon.”&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>She continued: “I saw firsthand how the ways we nurture and celebrate hair can directly impact our souls. I watched her heal and be of service to so many women. Having learned so much on my hair journey, I’ve always dreamed of carrying on her legacy. I can’t wait for you to experience what I’ve been creating.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The post, of course, prompted members of the Beyhive to comment their thrilled reactions. “I am ready to spend my moneyyyy,” one fan wrote in the comments section. A second joked, “She about to take all our coins again” as a third asked, “ARE WE GETTING A WIG LINE?!”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5eyurvNnJxmoaNiuaLBzZyfoqaXYq5uusSwZKmdopvCrrGMsJ%2BarF2pvG63zaiuaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bob-born-father-of-peeps-dead-at-98.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bob Born, the 'Father of Peeps' Dead at 98</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-alex-boye-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Alex Boye Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

A chief disciple of the Bengali yoga guru Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri, he was sent by his lineage to spread the teachings of yoga to the West, to prove the unity between Eastern and Western religions and to preach a balance between Western material growth and Indian spirituality. His long-standing influence in the American yoga movement, and especially the yoga culture of Los Angeles, led him to be considered by yoga experts as the "Father of Yoga in the West." Yogananda was the first major Indian teacher to settle in America, and the first prominent Indian to be hosted in the White House; his early acclaim led to him being dubbed "the 20th century's first superstar guru," by the Los Angeles Times.</p><table class=wikibox readability=11><tr readability=11><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>Mukunda Lal Ghosh, January 5, 1893, Gorakhpur, North-Western Provinces, British India, (Presently: Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, India</td></tr><tr readability=7><td class=wk_label>Died</td><td class=wk_value>March 7, 1952, Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Nationality</td><td class=wk_value>Indian and American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=wk_label>Founder of</td><td class=wk_value>Self-Realization Fellowship /Yogoda Satsanga Society of India</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=wk_label>Order</td><td class=wk_value>Self-Realization Fellowship Order</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Guru</td><td class=wk_value>Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Philosophy</td><td class=wk_value>Kriya Yoga</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Literary works</td><td class=wk_value>Bibliography</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Notable disciple(s)</td><td class=wk_value>See</td></tr></table><p>Young Adult Author Paramahansa Yogananda was born in India on January 5, 1893.

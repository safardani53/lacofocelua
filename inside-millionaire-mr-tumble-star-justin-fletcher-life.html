I do country walks. I go fishing a bit.</p><p>“I take the dogs for a walk. I visit friends, and I'm trying to give myself a bit more time off, but it always seems to fail because I am a bit of a workaholic.”</p><h2 id=car-lover>Car lover</h2><p>Discussing his hobbies, he revealed: “I'm quite into classic cars. I'm quite fascinated by things like that.</p><p>“I've got a couple of prop cars. They're two minis - they've been cut in half and then put back together so they're tiny. They've got little eyes as well. And I've got five 1950s bumper cars. And I've got a little MGB. So I tinker around with those cars when I've got a minute.”</p><p>Fans of Something Special will know that Justin is constantly in great spirits and the actor, who was awarded an MBE by the Queen, has previously insisted he’s just a happy person – and he doesn’t swear.</p><p>He explained: “I don’t get grumpy but when I feel really tired I get very quiet and people know I’ve hit the wall.</p><p>“I don’t swear, actually.

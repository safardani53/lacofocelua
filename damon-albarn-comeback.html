All those 23s must mean something...good or bad!”</p><p>It’s hard to argue with him. How many performers are star attractions at <a href=#>America’s</a> biggest music festival, <a href=#>Coachella</a>, AND Wembley Stadium shows this year?</p><p>Then consider that he’s frontman of two very different acts.</p><p>First up are synth pop-orientated Gorillaz and then it’s over to Blur for a giant guitar-fuelled summer reunion party.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON DAMON ALBARN">READ MORE ON DAMON ALBARN</h2><p>We’re meeting in what can loosely be described as Damon’s “office” on the top floor of his London studio, in the shadow of his beloved Westway.</p><p>Today, he’s going for a baggy denim skateboarder look, in keeping with the boyish spirit that still dwells within the 54-year-old cultural polymath.</p><p>We’re surrounded by racks of the vintage keyboards — Casio, Yamaha and others — which he employs for his various projects.</p><p>Whether it’s Gorillaz or Blur or solo work or Africa Express or you name it, Damon has always got something on the go.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Music</h2></p><p>“I’ve been having a good run with my songwriting,” he affirms.</p><p>“Though, to be fair, the creative juices have never really gone away.</p><p>“I just enjoy what I do. I have genuinely found my vocation and I’ll keep going until I can’t do it any more.”</p><p>The main focus of our chat on a clear blue February morning is the eighth Gorillaz studio album, Cracker Island.</p><p>It’s a typically effervescent song cycle featuring some of the most stellar guests in the cartoon band’s 25-year history.</p><p>Among them is <a href=#>Puerto Rican</a> rapper and singer <a href=#>Bad Bunny</a> (Benito Ocasio), the hottest music property in the US right now if the charts are anything to go by.</p><p>He applies a Spanish language masterclass to Tormenta in a style known as “reggaeton” — a conflation of dancehall, hip-hop and Latin American music.</p><p>“Bad Bunny’s the real deal,” enthuses Damon. “He’s got one of those annoying voices which is exactly right every time. So accurate and so consistent, it’s amazing.</p><p>“When I hear people like him, I think, ‘If I could sing like that, I would be the biggest artist in the world, but I can’t, so I’m not!’”</p><p>Damon credits his work with Bad Bunny to daughter Missy and her friend Salima.</p><p>“They grew up together and went to the Spanish school at the top of our road,” he says. “So they’re attuned to Latin music and into reggaeton.”</p><p>With Bad Bunny on Damon’s radar, “a long period of to and fro” messages ensued before they finally recorded a song.</p><p>He says: “Towards the end of lockdown when everything was opening up, we went to <a href=#>Jamaica</a> to do the Gorillaz EP Meanwhile.</p><p>“And because Bad Bunny lives in Puerto Rico, which is close by, it was the perfect place for us to meet up.</p><p>If I could sing like Bad Bunny, I'd be the world's biggest star... but I can't!</p><p>“I went with my daughter and her mates and so they got to meet him, too.</p><p>“We recorded the track very quickly, very spontaneously, after a huge storm, hence the name Tormenta (Spanish for storm).”</p><p>Elsewhere on Cracker Island, Fleetwood Mac’s <a href=#>Stevie Nicks</a> lends gorgeously sultry vocals to Oil while Thundercat strikes up a handsome bass groove and sings on the scene-setting title track.</p><p>Classy contributions also come from Tame Impala, rapper Bootie Brown, Beck and one-time <a href=#>Amy Winehouse</a> backing singer Adeleye Omotayo.</p><p>As with everything Gorillaz, there are two narratives at play. One belongs to Damon and his songs about global concerns and real emotions.</p><p>The other is artist Jamie Hewlett’s wacky virtual world of 2-D (singer/keyboards), Murdoc Niccals (bass), Noodle (lead guitar) and Russel Hobbs (drums).</p><p>This time, both sides collide because Damon decamped to Los Angeles to record with in-demand producer and songwriter Greg Kurstin (<a href=#>Adele</a>, Foo Fighters, Paul McCartney and countless others).</p><h2>‘Old school synths’</h2><p>And, in the fictional narrative, the cartoon characters pitch up in the <a href=#>LA</a> suburb of Silver Lake, where band leader and supreme ego Murdoc sets himself up as Great Leader of the Last Cult.</p><p>The original idea had been to make a Gorillaz movie, so what better setting to make it than in the home of the <a href=#>Hollywood</a> film industry?</p><p>Damon admits: “The movie was the reason for going in the first place.</p><p>“We had a contract with <a href=#>Netflix</a> but got unceremoniously dumped when our guy there moved on. That’s LA!”</p><p>Despite this setback, the change of scenery proved a breath of fresh West Coast air so he hooked up with Kurstin instead to make music.</p><p>“It was a great experience with Greg,” he says. “He’s a brilliant musician, same age as me and we grew up loving the same stuff.”</p><p>They also bonded over their shared love of old school synths.</p><p>“He’s got a couple of instruments I don’t have,” admits a slightly rueful Damon.</p><p>“One is a Yamaha synonymous with the big keyboard sounds of the Eighties.</p><p>“I didn’t buy one at the right time and now you’re looking at paying nearly £100,000 for one. But I’ve rinsed Greg’s on this whole album.”</p><p>Damon says the songs came thick and fast. “We literally banged out the record in nine days. Just him and me — apart from a little bass from Thundercat.”</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">2-D</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/newspress-collage-21497986-1677199993292.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>STUART POT, aka 2-D, is the sweet-voiced singer and keyboard player in Gorillaz.</p><p>A fan of zombie films and peppermint beverages, 2-D joined the band when Murdoc ran him over.</p><p>That was the first of many knocks on the head, which gave the blue-haired frontman a unique way of seeing the world.</p><p>Ambition: Running the dodgems at the funfair.</p><p>At the same time, he fell in love with his surroundings. “I don’t know what happened, whether <a href=#>Los Angeles</a> decided it liked me or I decided I liked Los Angeles,” he adds.</p><p>I had hated it for many years, having been stuck in the static environment of Sunset Boulevard where all bands stay when they’re touring.”</p><p>But during lockdown and before heading out to the US, Damon learned to drive again, despite the bicycle being his preferred mode of transport.</p><p>This allowed him to get back the licence he briefly owned 25 years ago but lost when he accrued nine points.</p><p>“When I got to LA, I hired a car for the first time,” he says. “So I was driving myself everywhere — upstate, downstate, into the desert, into East LA where the Latino culture I love exists.</p><p>“I suddenly realised that it was a very creative place and that I had completely and utterly misjudged it. Pure ignorance had caused my prejudice.”</p><p>Damon’s new base soon had a profound effect on his endeavours, as he explains.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/newspress-collage-21497986-1677199993292.jpg><p>“So many of my favourite musicians live there. You can call up Beck or Stevie Nicks because they live round the corner.”</p><p>That said, he remains wary of being sucked into the lifestyle of LA’s rich and famous.</p><p>“I don’t want to live there,” he stresses. “I’m not going to be one of those!</p><p>“I’m wary of the transformation that takes place when I spend too much time there.</p><p>“In The Hills, you get the feeling that everyone lives in such rarefied air.</p><p>“It’s very Roman in the sense that they look down on the city.</p><p>“And in downtown LA, skid row is a real thing which upset me so much.</p><p>“You see an impassive <a href=#>Amazon</a> robot delivering a pair of socks, travelling past poor homeless people.”</p><p>We digress so I ask Damon how he got Nicks on board for the Gorillaz record.</p><p>“Greg Kurstin instigated it,” he replies.</p><p>“I originally had that tune down — believe it or not — for Julian Casablancas (The Strokes singer).</p><p>“But Greg asked, ‘Why don’t you try Stevie? I know her and I’m going to see her next week’.</p><p>“I said, ‘Be my guest, play it to her’. I didn’t think she would agree in a million years but she liked the subject matter.”</p><p>Oil reflects Damon’s attempt to assimilate “the madness of planet earth” which, metaphorically speaking, is like being bombarded by “interlocking cluster bombs”.</p><p>He’s pleased to report that, rather like 2010’s Plastic Beach, the album has an overarching theme.</p><p>“Every time you go on <a href=#>social media</a>, you enter a labyrinth of cults,” he says. “And then you go and live in a cult-de-sac.</p><p>He repeats “cult-de-sac” and says: “That’s worthy of The Sun isn’t it? Who needs an Oxbridge education to come up with a pun like that?”</p><p>Damon elaborates: “Cracker Island starts in a dark place. A ‘cracker’ is American slang for a crazy white person and I thought it would be good to put all the crazy white people on an island to indulge in theories about flat earth etc.”</p><p>Closing song, wistful, acoustic Possession Island featuring Beck, serves as the album’s reality check. “It’s the place for reaching an understanding that all of this doesn’t really matter,” says Damon.</p><p>Current single Silent Running, which bears the soulful tones of Adeleye Omotayo, gives him cause for special celebration.</p><p>“It’s on the f***ing <a href=#>Radio 2</a> A-list!” he exclaims. “I’ve never been on it in my entire life.</p><p>“When I was down in <a href=#>Devon</a>, an old guy I know turned up unannounced and said, ‘You’ve got a new song, haven’t you?</p><p>“‘I’ve heard your music, but don’t understand a bloody word you’re saying’.”</p><p>But Damon’s not complaining and continues: “It’s nice to get played. I haven’t been afforded the luxury that often.</p><p>“Maybe my music’s too left field? The mood tends to be a bit melancholic while radio goes for subtle up, up, up.”</p><p>Finally, he spares thoughts for Gorillaz associates no longer with us, Terry Hall of The Specials, who sang on 911, and Dave “Trugoy” Jolicoeur, of De La Soul, who co-wrote and performed on Feel Good Inc.</p><p>“I’ve lost two good friends who have really inspired me,” he says. “I had no idea Terry was so ill, otherwise I’d have gone to see him.</p><p>“What he and Dave had in common was building bridges between cultures in a very meaningful way.</p><p>“For my development, both were hugely important. I’m just carrying their flames.”</p><p>At some point in the future, Damon would like someone else to carry the Gorillaz flame.</p><p>“I’d like to pass it on to another guy who’s a cartoonist and a musician,” he decides. “That would be amazing.”</p><p>Gorillaz forever!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/msemail_GORILLAZ_CRACKER_ISLAND_Digital_Artworkjpg-JS797342483.jpg><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">MURDOC</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/newspress-collage-21497986-1677200108774.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>GORILLAZ founder/bass maestro Murdoc Niccals is driven by his insatiable need to be loved, which is ironic seeing as he makes enemies of almost everyone.</p><p>The thinking person’s hedonist, Murdoc is always last to leave a party, often in handcuffs with a uniformed official.</p><p>Some claim he sold his soul to the devil to get famous.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Q&A</h2><p>SFTW has spoken to some big names over the years...but none bigger than Murdoc Niccals of Gorillaz.</p><p>We can’t meet him face to face due to his packed schedule running a band and the Last Cult.</p><p>But thanks to Zoom, Murdoc talks to us from the “throne room” at his Silver Lake mansion.</p><p>He’s wearing full high priest-style cult regalia, comprising long flowing robes and a ridiculous hat.</p><p>Just before unveiling the video for new single Silent Running, he grants Simon Cosyns an audience.</p><p><strong>GREAT Leader and “seeker of the truth”, what’s your best advice to all the lost lambs of the world?</strong></p><p>Bravo mate, excellent question and solid effort with my cult titles, too.</p><p>I’d also accept ‘He-who-shall-not-be-gazed-upon’.</p><p>Well, Simon, my advice to you (as clearly you are the lost lamb of your question) is to embrace your cosmic smallness.</p><p>Stop trying to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders. Waste of calories, mate. What will be will be.</p><p>Ultimately you are powerless to prevent the imploding of the universe, so you might as well stop fretting and go to the pub.</p><p><strong>Why did you move to Silver Lake, oh wise one?</strong></p><p>Officially, this is Year One of the Last Cult, thus I have been presiding over my flock here at Silver Lake since the dawn of time.</p><p>But, in the before-times, we upped sticks from Blighty after a demonic sinkhole opened under our West London studio.</p><p>You should pop over some time. Just turn left at Greenland.</p><p><strong>Why did you choose pink as cult colour of choice?</strong></p><p>Some cultures believe that pink, being equal parts red and white, represents the coming together of humans and gods.</p><p>Personally, I like it ’cos it doesn’t clash with my greenish pallor. I almost went for a maroon red, then I got a cease-and-desist letter from the Sunflower Apostles of Venus.</p><p><strong>How’s 2D doing these days... still having cups of tea with your nemesis Moon Flower?</strong></p><p>2D is a heretic and a non-believer, Simon. I’ve excommunicated him for indulging in precisely what you described.</p><p>Just a little catch-up for your readers, turns out our next-door neighbours are also a cult.</p><p>Lot of them about in LA. Anyway, 2D’s been fraternising with them, got pally with their head honchess Moon Flower and her acolytes, call themselves the Forever Cult.</p><p>The lad is incredibly weak-minded and susceptible to techniques like hugs, kind platitudes, hot beverages and so forth.</p><p><strong>What’s all this about him being sacrificed?</strong></p><p>I know! I’m as furious as you are, pal. If anyone gets to sacrifice 2D it should be me, not those numpties next door.</p><p>That’s why we’re staging an intervention. Russ reckons he’s figured out the time and the place of the sacrificial ceremony and is advocating a rescue mission.</p><p>Originally I had a diary clash but I’ve managed to move Pilates to the following week.</p><p>Last year, Russel predicted the Great Rupture for <a href=#>New Year’s Eve</a>, but there’s still no sign of it?</p><p>Yeah, Russ convinced himself that at midnight a crack would open above the Hollywood sign, revealing a pathway to paradise.</p><p>He hiked up there by himself, even packed a suitcase.</p><p>Obviously nothing happened. He came home with the right hump.</p><p>It’s a shame really, people always expect too much from New Year’s Eve.</p><p>Now Russ is saying he got his dates jumbled up, and the Rupture is actually happening some other time.</p><p>But that time is most definitely ALMOST nigh, he assures me.</p><p><strong>I hear Noodle’s been looking into the Forever Cult?</strong></p><p>Our Noodle’s been digging into Moon Flower and her goons.</p><p>Reckons the neighbours in the Forever Cult were an old movie studio back in the dark ages of Hollywood.</p><p>Even found a review of one of their silent films, a real turkey.</p><p><strong>Finally, what do you know about Cracker Island?</strong></p><p>Ten tracks of era-defining sonic gold, mate, featuring Gorillaz, a load of our pals, and a big dose of LA sunshine.</p><p>And a modicum of culty spiritual nourishment from yours truly.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>OK, ta Simon, always a pleasure.

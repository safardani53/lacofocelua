The race car driver, 34, is one of Allen’s close friends. Steinfeld was seen sitting on Ricciardo’s right, per a photo ESPN’s Buffalo Bills reporter<strong> Alaina Getzenberg</strong> shared via <a href=#>X</a> (formerly known as Twitter).</p><p>Steinfeld was not highlighted as a celeb in attendance. She kept a low profile, wearing her long hair loose and keeping her black sunglasses on. She showed her Bills loyalty by wearing a blue, white and red Bills hoodie.</p><p>The game, one of a handful of NFL games that are played in the U.K., wasn’t a victorious one for the Bills. They lost to the Jacksonville Jaguars, 25-20.</p><p>The Oscar-nominated actress has quietly supported Allen, 27, throughout the football season. She was seen in September with <a href=#>his mother, <strong>Lavonne Allen</strong></a>, at Leveled Up Buffalo, a women’s boutique with an extensive collection in Buffalo Bills colors. The pair posed with shop owner Lindsey Vega, who captioned the snap via Instagram, “Pinch Me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Hailee-Steinfeld-Cheers-On-Boyfriend-Josh-Allen-With-Daniel-Ricciardo-at-U-K-Buffalo-Bills-Game-01.jpg><p>Allen was first linked to Steinfeld in May 2023. “Hailee and Josh have been together for about a month and it’s going really great,” an insider exclusively told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> in June. “[They] laugh a ton when they’re together [and] are always smiling.”</p><p>While the NFL star was fresh off his breakup from longtime girlfriend<strong> Brittany Williams</strong> at the time, Steinfeld had been single for a while. Her last public romance was with<strong> Niall Horan</strong> in 2018. “Josh is the first guy in a while she’s been really interested in,” the source told Us.</p><p>The two were spotted out several times over the summer, leading to Allen finally <a href=#>acknowledging their relationship</a> in an August episode of the “Pardon My Take” podcast.</p><p>“The fact that anybody cares about that still blows my mind,” Allen shared.</p><p>He addressed headlines about the pair “making out” on vacation, noting that photographers on boats snapped the photos. “I just, like, felt this gross feeling,” Allen added. “Insecurity. No privacy. [I was] like, ‘What is wrong with people?’”</p><p>Steinfeld is similarly private. She <a href=#>exclusively told Us</a> in 2018 that she liked to keep her love life on the down-low.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I feel so lucky that [my fans] care enough about me to know what I’m doing every second of every day, but I think that sometimes it’s hard for people in general to realize that there are boundaries to a person’s life and personal life,” she said at the time.</p><p>She continued: “I am a very private person. I do love that I have the opportunity to share with them what I’m comfortable with and they’re there to listen and support me.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahmZmhsqZ50q2coqaWmrmledKup6mnoqnAbq7Osp2roZWjsW62zqyfZpmcobKvecCtZJutlpuurbuMm6ClpKNitKK5xGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cheapest-town-uk-affordable-homes-shildon-durham.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>I live in UKs most affordable town - you can snap up a home for 35k and a pint is 2 but there</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chris-appleton-celebrates-40th-birthday-husband-lukas-gage-exclusive-7547790.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chris Appleton Celebrates 40th Birthday with Husband Lukas Gage (Exclusive)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

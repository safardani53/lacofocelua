During his original run in 2004, one of his most memorable mistakes happened when he was answering a question in the “Tool Time” category.</p><p>“This term for a long-handled gardening tool can also mean an immoral pleasure seeker,” read late host <a href=#>Alex Trebek</a>. Jennings, who had a commanding lead at the time, rang in with the response, “What’s a hoe?” As the audience began to laugh, Trebek quipped, “Whoa, whoa, whoa! They teach you that in school in Utah, huh?” (The Chase cohost graduated from the state’s Brigham Young University.)</p><p>The Planet Funny author later found himself at the center of a Jeopardy! controversy when some of his old tweets resurfaced just before he began his first stint as a guest host for the show <a href=#>following Trebek’s November 2020 death</a>. “Nothing sadder than a hot person in a wheelchair,” read one tweet Jennings posted in 2014.</p><p>The former software engineer <a href=#>apologized for the posts</a>, saying that they “worked as jokes” in his mind but didn’t read so well on screen. “Sometimes I said dumb things in a dumb way and I want to apologize to people who were (rightfully!) offended,” he tweeted in December 2020. “It wasn’t my intention to hurt anyone, but that doesn’t matter; I screwed up, and I’m truly sorry.”</p><p>Jeopardy! proceeded with Jennings’ gig as a guest host, but the Wall Street Journal later reported that the tweets may have cost him a job as Trebek’s permanent replacement. In August 2021, <a href=#>Sony Pictures announced that executive producer</a> <a href=#><strong>Mike Richards</strong></a> would take over as the syndicated game show’s permanent host, but <a href=#>Richards resigned days later</a> after multiple of his own controversies.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After Richards’ departure, <a href=#><strong>Mayim Bialik</strong></a>, who had been announced as the host for primetime and spin-off specials, began filling in as the show’s interim host. The <a href=#>Big Bang Theory</a> alum has since alternated with Jennings, who is still a consulting producer on the show. In July 2022, Variety reported that the dynamic duo will <a href=#>continue sharing hosting duties</a>.</p><p>Keep scrolling for a look back at some of the wildest and most controversial moments in Jeopardy! history.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BfsrC8wKubsmWdnsC1rcqeqmavmaGxbrnOppynrKNivLex0WaroZ1drrKivtJo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./blink-182-stadium-tour-tickets.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Blink-182 2024 stadium tour: How can I buy tickets?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-good-doctors-paige-spara-inside-a-day-in-my-life.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Good Doctors Paige Spara: Inside a Day in My Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

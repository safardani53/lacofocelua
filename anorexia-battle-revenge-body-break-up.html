It steals away your actual identity.</p><p>"I started off dieting because of the pressure from platforms like <a href=#>TikTok</a> – and it almost killed me."</p><p>Jess began dieting in early 2020 after splitting from her partner.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Health</h2></p><p>She said: "I was heavily influenced by the women I saw on social media, who were all skinnier than me, and I thought that losing weight would make me more attractive.&nbsp;</p><p>"I was a little on the slim side and I had just been through a break-up and I wanted a ‘revenge body,’ to make me feel good about myself again.</p><p>"At first, I was just cutting calories, but it became an addiction.</p><p>"Because it was lockdown, I had nothing else to focus on, and so I became obsessed with not eating, I'd binge and then be sick."</p><p>Her illness quickly progressed to anorexia, and Jess felt as though she was living with a constant bully.</p><p>"The anorexia told me I wasn’t allowed to eat before 12," she said.</p><p>"It said I was fat and ugly and didn’t deserve food. It said I had to do 20,000 steps a day.</p><p>"I was becoming weaker and weaker and yet I was powerless to stop it.</p><p>"People kept telling me to just eat, but I couldn’t."</p><h2>POWERLESS TO HELP</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/young-woman-described-battling-anorexia-835856486-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/young-woman-described-battling-anorexia-835856361.jpg><p>Jess’s parents, Andrew, 59, and Deborah, 59, and her twin sister, Lucy, were becoming increasingly concerned.</p><p>Jess said: "Lucy and I have always been very close, as twins, yet I couldn’t even talk to her about it.</p><p>"She wanted to help me, but I didn’t want her help.</p><p>"She would do things like slip full fat milk into my coffee and I saw her as the enemy.

Some just didn’t understand how ill I was. I didn’t socialise at all.</p><p>"I had to either defer my university studies or accept an absence, and I became very isolated.</p><p>"I was stuck in a black hole of emptiness and loneliness."</p><h2>TURNING POINT</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/young-woman-described-battling-anorexia-835856448.jpg><p>With her family’s encouragement, Jess saw her <a href=#>GP</a> who explained that, with <a href=#>bulimia</a>, she was not thin enough for a referral, and instead ran blood tests.</p><p>But by November 2022, her parents were so concerned that they took her straight to hospital, and she was admitted to an <a href=#>eating disorder</a> unit where she stayed for some time.</p><p>Jess said: "It was a real wake up call.</p><p>"I was told I wasn’t safe to drive, because my BMI was too low.</p><p>"I was warned I shouldn’t even have a shower, because the force of the water could trigger a heart attack.</p><p>"My periods had stopped, and I was told I might already have <a href=#>fertility issues</a>.</p><p>"I had lost my independence and put my life at risk, yet it had all started with a silly diet, with the pursuit of perfection, as defined by social media.</p><p>"I saw being thin as somehow glamorous.

She is almost back to her pre-anorexic weight, and has also continued her university studies.</p><p>"I am speaking out because I want to warn other young women, and men, that nothing is worth risking your life for," she said.</p><p>"Anorexia will steal away your happiness, your independence, and your whole identity.</p><p>"When I look back at photos from my illness, it makes me so sad.

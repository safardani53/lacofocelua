It all started when the Atlanta rapper slid into Cheaves’ DMs. Cheaves was living in Savannah at the time.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>But when Lil baby found that her sister, Ameerah, was in Atlanta, he recruited Ameerah’s help, and thanks to her, Lil Baby finally met Cheaves. The two hit it off immediately, and before you knew it, <a href=# rel=follow>Cheaves</a> was Lil Baby’s girlfriend.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, the couple hit the first bump in their relationship when Lil Baby admitted that he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">cheated on his girlfriend</a> with another woman, Ayesha, who is the mother of his oldest son.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>But Cheaves shrugged it off, and during an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">DJ Smallz Eyes</a> in June 2018, Cheaves shared that they were pretty serious. Then, a few months later, in September, she surprised everyone with a baby bump.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>And by February 2019, Cheaves and Lil Baby welcomed their first child together. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Lil Baby and His Former Girlfriend Hit Rough Patch</h2><p>Things were going well for Lil Baby and his girlfriend after the birth of their baby.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In September 2019&nbsp;during an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sheen</a>, Cheaves opened up about what it was like to be a supportive girlfriend while juggling her mommy duties.</p><p>Being a girlfriend to a rapper is much like being a girlfriend to anyone else. You show your partner that you care, support their dreams, and stay in their corner.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>However, the couple appeared to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">hit another snag</a> in early 2020 after Lil Baby made it clear he wasn’t deeply in love with anyone. Soon after, his girlfriend confirmed that they had broken up, saying there was no bad blood between them, and that she was focusing on their son.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>But it wasn’t long until Cheaves teased a patch up by posting a photo of her and Lil Baby kissing to her Instagram Stories. Then <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">cheating rumors</a> circulated that Lil Baby had paid an adult film actress to sleep with him, which he denied at first but later admitted to.&nbsp;</p><p>The duo then unfollowed each other on Instagram, after which Lil Baby deleted his account while Cheaves removed all traces of him from her grid.</p><h2>Lil Baby and His Former Girlfriend Spotted Together</h2><p>Lil Baby and Cheaves appeared to be on break indefinitely until they were <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">spotted at an event together</a> in August.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The rapper and his former girlfriend turned heads when they were seen together at James Harden’s birthday bash in Houston. According to The Shade Room, one of her fans’ pages shared a video of the two linking up at the party.&nbsp;</p><p>They came together looking adorable and struck poses in their similar yellow-themed outfits.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the two of them being spotted together did not confirm they were back together, this re-sparked relationship rumors. People assumed they were back together and expressed it in the comments.</p><p>Not everyone was happy about their alleged reunion, with one user commenting, “We want single Jayda.”&nbsp;</p><p>However, nothing has been confirmed yet, and it is unclear if they are together or not.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><h2>&nbsp;</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKSZoXqjrcGyZKChoqGzs7XEp5tnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./big-sean-taller-this-year-going-to-the-chiropractor.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Big Sean Says He Grew 2 Inches Taller This Year by Going to the Chiropractor</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./anastassija-makarenko.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Anastassija Makarenko Age, Height, Net Worth, Wiki, Boyfriend</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./drake-spends-just-two-minutes-in-london-nightclub-after-being-paid-15k-to-make-an-appearance.html>Drake spends just TWO minutes in London nightclub after being paid 15K to make an appearance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessie-bates-iii-tjci-html.html>Jessie Bates III (Football Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-harvick-kids-keelan-and-piper-with-wife-delana.html>Kevin Harvick Kids Keelan &amp;amp; Piper Are His Motivation- Wife DeLana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-swift-stonewall-day-pride-live-2020-speech-video.html>Taylor Swifts Pride Live Stonewall Day Appearance: Video Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-thinking-of-ending-things-poem.html>The Poem in 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things' Explained</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.

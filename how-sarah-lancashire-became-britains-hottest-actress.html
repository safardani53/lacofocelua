not in front of it.</p><p>Sarah, one of four siblings, had a grounded upbringing in Oldham where her dad Geoffrey Lancashire wrote for Coronation Street and her mum Hilda worked as his personal assistant.</p><p>She went to Oldham Hulme Grammar School from 1976 to 1981 and won a spot at the coveted Guildhall School of Music and Drama, graduating in 1986.</p><p>She won two roles in plays with the Manchester Library Company - The Beauty Game and Pacific Overtures - but later said she found the experience terrifying because she "wore a bathing costume in some of the scenes and got heckled".</p><p>Sarah went on to work as a drama tutor at Salford University for five years.</p><p>She would later say she never won acting gigs&nbsp;because she was “useless at auditions” when she was younger.</p><p>But then she landed a small role in <a href=#>Coronation Street</a> as Wendy Farmer, a potential lodger for Jack Duckworth in 1987. It would change her life forever.</p><p>Producers were impressed.&nbsp; Four years later she was cast as loveable Rovers barmaid Raquel Wolstenhulme - initially on a three month contract.</p><p>But, as the Street’s supermarket boss Curly Watts fell in love with Raquel, so did viewers.&nbsp;</p><h2>£90K a year</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/itv-plc-reproduced-editorial-purposes-592801056.jpg><p>Raquel's ditzy manner may not have been that far removed from Sarah’s childhood persona.</p><p>She once said: &nbsp;"My three brothers were all quite intellectual, while I was a bit dippy as a child. I just went round singing 'la, la, la,' and doing handstands.</p><p>“The best my mother hoped for me was that I would meet a nice man, settle down and have children."</p><p>Sarah, who went on to earn a reported £90,000 a year in Corrie, created one of the soap’s most iconic characters.</p><p>A TV special which followed Raquel and Curly’s honeymoon sold 750,000 VHS copies in 1995. She also won Rear of the Year in 1993.</p><p>Her last Corrie episode a year later was watched by 20 million viewers and she was nominated Most Popular Actress at the National Television Awards.</p><p>It won her a £1.3 million golden handcuffs deal with <a href=#>ITV</a> - one of the first of its kind.</p><p>When she cut loose from it in 2002, ITV drama chief Nick Elliott called her his “best buy” in his 38-year-career.</p><p>She went on to play Ruth Goddard in Where the Heart Is from 1997 to 1999, then a lesbian head teacher in BBC drama Last Tango in Paris between 2012 and 2016.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2017 she was awarded an OBE from the Queen and received the honour from the <a href=#>Prince William.</a></p><h2>Depression struggle</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2000-sarah-lancashire-stars-coral-1382243.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/b1626f21-e5b2-4594-aca9-978949039a3d.jpg><p>In 2000 she delivered a powerful performance as actress Coral Atkins, who set up a home for disadvantaged kids after being moved by the plight of children in care.</p><p>But it was her role in the first series of Happy Valley in 2014 that has arguably earned her the most plaudits.</p><p><a href=#>Sally Wainwright</a> wrote the role especially for Sarah after being blown away by her in Last Tango.</p><p>But behind the scenes, Sarah struggled with episodes of depression and anxiety.</p><p>She told The Sun she was diagnosed with clinical depression at 18, saying: “I have never known what it feels like to wake up in the morning, full of the joys of spring, and wander through the day feeling capable of coping."</p><p>She told how she suffered from clinical depression in the 1990s and had a breakdown, calling it a “ticking time bomb waiting to go off".</p><p>Sarah said she was on medication while shooting Corrie and twice considered taking her own life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/english-actress-sarah-lancashire-poses-781731390.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/brett-d-cove-splash-news-324022158.jpg><p>The thought of getting out of bed left her "hysterical" and, although her family knew of her struggles, she never told anyone at ITV.</p><p>She said she was prescribed tranquillisers which ended up “being the worst thing for it" and "ended up in a terrible mess. My twenties were a write-off".</p><p>“I certainly didn’t tell anybody at the studios and I didn’t take any time off," Sarah explained. "I was terrified of being judged and misunderstood. I just battled along.</p><p>“It’s the worst thing I could have done. Being in the public eye makes you frightened to talk openly about things - which is precisely why you should. You can really a difference and open up subjects that are taboo.”</p><p>A few years ago she described herself as a “little more together” joking she was “just about ready to get on a bus by herself".</p><h2>Unhappy marriage</h2><p>Her unhappiness during her first marriage most likely didn't help Sarah’s state of mind.</p><p>Aged 22 she married her first serious boyfriend Gary Hargreaves, a music lecturer 11 years her senior.&nbsp;</p><p>She confessed she only got married because she was pregnant, although her first child Thomas was not born until 1987. Her second, Matthew, followed in 1989.</p><p>She told the Mirror: “I’m a very traditional girl and was horrified at the thought of having a child out of wedlock.</p><p>“I didn’t want a child of mine to be different or have fingers pointed at them. The marriage lasted for 10 years which was 10 years longer than it should have done.”</p><p>In 2000, news broke that Sarah, then 36, was in a relationship with her ex Granada TV boss Peter Salmon, then 44, who at the time was estranged from his wife of 20 years, Penny Watt.</p><p>A friend of Peter's at the time told the <a href=# aria-label="Daily Mail: (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail:</a> "It has been an agonising decision for him but he and Sarah do not want to live a lie."</p><p>Peter&nbsp;famously refused to move to Salford despite being the head of the Beeb’s Corporation North division.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>He promised he would move up north after his children, including son Joseph who he had with Sarah in 2003, had finished school but he left the corporation in 2013.</p><h2>'Precious' family</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/actress-sarah-lancashire-husband-peter-3300801.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/embargoed-publication-uk-tabloid-newspapers-790645964.jpg><p>Sarah has described their relationship as "precious” but keeps their family life under wraps.</p><p>“I guard it because it’s very precious. It’s not a piece of drama. It is real life, my normal life. And I value my normality,” she said.</p><p>For her first American role, Julia, Sarah flew to Los Angeles to audition and took son Joseph to make a holiday of it.</p><p>The modest star was shocked when her agent called to say she’d got the role, which she has made her own - despite Meryl Streep also playing the chef in the 2009 hit Julie & Julia.</p><p>Sarah said she deliberately didn’t watch Streep’s portrayal for a second time after watching the comedy-drama when it first came out.</p><p><a href=#>Covid</a> restrictions halted filming, and when it resumed in summer 2021, Sarah was unable to see her family which was difficult.</p><p>She might be the hottest acting ticket in town but she views motherhood as her most important job.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“The older that I get, the harder it is to be away from home," she said.</p><p>"I love being at home.

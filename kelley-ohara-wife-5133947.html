The star defender, who was a member of the gold medal-winning 2012 Olympic team, will play alongside <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Alex Morgan</a></strong> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Megan Rapinoe </strong></a>in an attempt to join <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>iconic soccer player </a><strong>Pelé </strong>as the only players to win three of the coveted World Cup trophies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Kelley-OHara-Wife-Kameryn-Stanhouse-ss-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>The soccer star currently plays defender as part of the Washington Spirit. She’s founded and hosts the podcast The Player’s Pod on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Just Women’s Sports.</a> She also has a massive presence on social media, with almost 800,000 followers on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>With her busy schedule, it would appear Kelley has little time for her personal life, but that is not the case. On New Year’s Eve, the athlete announced her engagement to girlfriend, <strong>Kameryn Stanhouse</strong>, who can be seen <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>here</strong></a>. Let’s learn more about Kelley’s soon-to-be wife, below.</p><h2>Where Is Kameryn From?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Kelley and Kameryn are both very private about their personal lives and relationships. Very little is known about Kameryn, other than the fact that she is&nbsp;the head of corporate ad sales at Politico, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Advocate</a>. Kameryn also does not appear to have a social media account at this time.</p><h2>How Did Kelley Meet Kameryn?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>While there is little information about the meet-cute for the soccer star and businesswoman, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People </a>reported that they “quickly became friends” after meeting through work. “At one point, we looked at each other and I think it clicked for both of us. Like, ‘Oh, I like you! And you like me?!’ ” Kelley told the outlet in July 2023.</p><h2>Their Kiss At The World Cup Went Viral</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>In 2019, when the U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team nabbed their second consecutive World Cup — their fourth overall — it was truly a monumental day in more ways than one. As soon as the team won, Kelley ran over to the stands and planted a big smooch on Kameryn, who was cheering her on during the game. The image, which can be seen <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>here</strong></a>, quickly went viral as it was a unique way to come out as queer, as Kelley was not publicly out at the time. The kiss made Kelley an instant icon in the LGBTQ+ community, per the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Advocate</a>.</p><h2>Kelley Calls Kameryn Her BFF</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>After the couple revealed their engagement, Kelley couldn’t help but gush over her fiancee to People. “She’s my best friend,” Kelley told the outlet. “She’s the biggest support system for me and I just feel lucky to have her in my life. We’ve been together for a long time now and been through so many milestones together, so it’s fun to think about forever. And we’re together forever.”</p><h2>When Did They Get Engaged?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>On January 2, 2023, Kelley took to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> to share a precious photo carousel (above) with some big news. The soccer star and her girlfriend were engaged! In the snaps, Kelley and Kameryn share a sweet kiss before showing off the gorgeous engagement ring! “saved the best for last in 2022 🥰,” Kelley&nbsp; captioned the post.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8qeo6WdqWK8qa3RmmSwoZaaenZ9kmxwbW9f</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./isabel-may-family-tree-is-she-related-to-tim-mcgraw-wiki-and-net-worth-details.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Isabel May Family Tree: Is She Related To Tim Mcgraw?

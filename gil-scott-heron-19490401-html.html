He and composer Brian Jackson performed a fusion of jazz, blues and soul, as well as lyrical content related to social and political affairs of the time, conveyed by Scott-Heron by rapping and melodious vocals. His own term for himself is "a researcher of blues", he defines as "a scientist interested in the origin of blues music". He is considered by many to be the first rapper in history. His music, most notably on Pieces of a Man and Winter in America in the early 1970s, influenced and heralded later African-American genres such as hip hop and anchor soul. His recording has received critical acclaim, especially for "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised".</p><table class=wikibox readability=25><tr><td class=wk_label>Birth name</td><td class=wk_value>Gilbert Scott-Heron</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>April 1, 1949, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=wk_label>Origin</td><td class=wk_value>New York City, New York, U.S.</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Died</td><td class=wk_value>May 27, 2011, New York City, New York, U.S.</td></tr><tr readability=8><td class=wk_label>Genres</td><td class=wk_value>Soul, jazz-funk, jazz poetry, funk, proto-rap, R&B, progressive soul</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=wk_label>Occupation(s)</td><td class=wk_value>Poet, singer-songwriter, author, musician</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=wk_label>Instruments</td><td class=wk_value>Vocals, piano, Rhodes piano, guitar</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Years active</td><td class=wk_value>1969–2011</td></tr><tr readability=8><td class=wk_label>Labels</td><td class=wk_value>RCA, Flying Dutchman, Strata East, Arista, TVT, XL, JAD Records</td></tr><tr readability=8><td class=wk_label>Associated acts</td><td class=wk_value>Brian Jackson, Ron Holloway, Malik & the O.G's, Musicians United for Safe Energy, Artists United Against Apartheid, Black and Blues</td></tr></table><p>Poet Gil Scott-Heron was born in Chicago, Illinois, United States on April 1, 1949.
